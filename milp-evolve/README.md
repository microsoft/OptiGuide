### Dataset Summary

MILP-Evolve is a large-scale dataset of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem classes and instances. It is generated using an LLM-based evolutionary framework capable of producing a diverse set of MILP classes with unlimited instances. The dataset is designed to facilitate research in developing foundation models for MILP that generalize across problem classes. It supports multiple learning tasks, including integrality gap prediction, learning to branch, and aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- **Integrality Gap Prediction:** This task involves predicting the integrality gap of MILP instances, which measures the difference between the optimal integer solution and the linear relaxation. Success is typically measured by a low mean squared error or high correlation between predicted and actual gaps. Models like regression-based neural networks can be trained using this dataset.

- **Learning to Branch:** The dataset can be used to train models that learn effective branching strategies within MILP solvers. Performance is measured by metrics such as reduced solve time, smaller branch-and-bound trees, or fewer nodes explored. Reinforcement learning models or imitation learning approaches are commonly used for this task.

- **Language-MILP Alignment:** This new task involves aligning MILP instances with their natural language descriptions. Success is measured by retrieval accuracy or alignment scores. Models like cross-modal transformers or contrastive learning frameworks can be applied.

### Languages

The dataset is primarily in English. It includes Python code for MILP formulations, natural language descriptions in English, and standard MILP file formats like MPS.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was created to overcome the limitations of existing MILP datasets, which often lack diversity and volume, hindering the generalization of deep learning models across different problem classes. MILP-Evolve aims to provide a diverse and extensive dataset to facilitate the development of foundation models in MILP.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

MILP-Evolve uses an LLM-based evolutionary framework to generate MILP code iteratively. Starting from 8 seed classes from previous literature, the framework employs OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate new MILP classes by applying various transformations like addition, mutation, and crossover. Each generated code is then subjected to parameter tuning and filtering to ensure computational feasibility and diversity.

#### Who are the source language producers?

The source data is machine-generated by the MILP-Evolve framework using GPT-4. The initial seed classes are standard MILP problems from established literature, reformatted into a modular code structure.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

Annotations such as integrality gaps and branching decisions are generated automatically. For integrality gaps, instances are solved using MILP solvers with specified time limits, and gaps are calculated based on the optimal solutions. For learning to branch, data is collected by solving instances and recording branching decisions, sometimes employing expert strategies like Strong Branching.

#### Who are the annotators?

Annotations are produced by computational processes and solvers without human intervention.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset does not contain personal or sensitive information. All data is synthetic and generated for research purposes.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

MILP-Evolve has the potential to significantly advance optimization and machine learning research. By enabling models that generalize across a wide range of MILP problems, it can lead to more efficient solutions in industries like logistics, supply chain, healthcare, and environmental planning. This can result in cost savings, improved resource utilization, and better decision-making processes.

This dataset is being released to facilitate further machine learning research and not for any real-world application. Users are responsible for developing, testing, and validating any models trained on this dataset before any implementation in the real world.

### Discussion of Biases

While efforts were made to ensure diversity, the dataset may still reflect biases inherent in the LLM's training data or the initial seed classes. Certain problem types or formulations might be overrepresented, and users should be cautious when generalizing results.

### Other Known Limitations

- **Generative Errors:** As the MILP classes are generated by an LLM, there might be syntactic or logical errors that passed the filtering process.
- **Computational Feasibility:** Some instances might be trivial or extremely hard to solve despite filtering for problem size and solve time.
- **Representation Gaps:** Despite the dataset's size, it may not cover all real-world MILP applications.
