It is known that one skilled worker can produce $10 \ \mathrm{kg} / \ \mathrm{h}$ of food I or $6 \ \mathrm{kg} / \ \mathrm{h}$ of food II. According to contract bookings, the weekly demand for these two foods will rise sharply, as shown in Table 1-11. Therefore, the factory has decided to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. It is known that a worker works $40 \ \mathrm{h}$ per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work $60 \ \mathrm{h}$ per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan. If the booked food cannot be delivered on time, the compensation fee for each week of delay per $ \ \mathrm{kg}$ is 0.5 yuan for food I and 0.6 yuan for food II. Under these conditions, how should the factory make comprehensive arrangements to minimize the total cost?

The plan must detail monthly in-house production levels, outsourcing quantities, and workforce management (hiring/firing).

**Initial Conditions (at the start of January):**
- Initial Workforce: 1,000 employees
- Initial Inventory: 15,000 units

**Revenue and Cost Structure:**
- **Sales Price:** 300 Yuan per unit sold.
- **Raw Material Cost:** 90 Yuan per unit, applicable *only* to units produced in-house.
- **Outsourcing Cost:** 200 Yuan per unit for finished tables acquired from a third-party supplier. This is an all-inclusive cost.
- **Inventory Holding Cost:** 15 Yuan per unit for any inventory held at the end of a month.
- **Backorder Cost:** 35 Yuan per unit for any unfulfilled demand (stockout) carried over to the next month.

**Labor and Production Parameters:**
- **Labor Requirement:** Each in-house unit requires 5 labor hours to produce.
- **Regular Labor:** Each worker provides 160 regular working hours per month (8 hours/day * 20 days/month). The company pays a regular wage of 30 Yuan/hour for these 160 hours, regardless of full utilization.
- **Overtime Labor:** Workers can perform overtime. Total overtime hours per month for the entire workforce cannot exceed 20 hours per worker. The overtime wage is 40 Yuan/hour.
- **Workforce Management:** The company can hire or fire workers each month. The cost to hire a new worker is 5,000 Yuan, and the cost to fire a worker is 8,000 Yuan.

**Demand and Fulfillment Logic:**
- Unfulfilled demand from one month is back-ordered and must be met in subsequent months.
- The company fulfills orders (both current demand and backorders) using available inventory from the previous month, current in-house production, and outsourced units.

**Terminal Condition (at the end of June):**
- The ending inventory must be at least 10,000 units.
- All backorders must be cleared (i.e., ending backorders must be zero).

Each container type is characterized by a specific volume, market demand, and unit variable production cost, as detailed in Table 5-11.

**Table 5-11: Container Data**
| Container Type (Code)             | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6     |
| :------------------------------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- |
| Volume ($\text{cm}^3$)             | 1500 | 2500 | 4000 | 6000 | 9000 | 12000 |
| Market Demand (units)           | 500  | 550  | 700  | 900  | 400  | 300   |
| Unit Variable Production Cost (Yuan/unit) | 5    | 8    | 10   | 12   | 16   | 18    |

The production of any container type necessitates the use of its dedicated specialized equipment. If the decision is made to **activate** the production equipment for a particular container type (i.e., if the production quantity of that type is greater than zero), a fixed setup cost of 1200 Yuan is incurred for that specific equipment.

Should the production quantity of a certain container type be insufficient to meet its direct demand, the factory has the option to utilize other container types with **larger or equal volume** as substitutes to fulfill this unmet demand. For instance, type 2 containers (volume 2500 $\text{cm}^3$) can be used to satisfy the demand for type 1 containers (requiring a volume of 1500 $\text{cm}^3$), but type 1 containers cannot be used for type 2 demand. In this problem, the container type codes are pre-sorted in ascending order of their volumes.

**Question:**
How should the factory organize its production? The objective is to develop a production plan that minimizes the total cost—comprising the sum of variable production costs for all containers produced and the fixed costs for all activated equipment—while ensuring that the demand for all container types is fully met.</td>

                        <td style="max-width: 400px; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959. It is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can be described as follows: in a certain area, there is a number of customers and a distribution center or depot. Customers are generally located at different positions, and each has a specific demand for goods. The distribution center needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design appropriate delivery routes to fulfill the demands of all customers. The objective of VRP is to optimize a certain benefit metric while satisfying all customer demands. The benefit metric is usually presented as an objective function, which varies according to the company&#x27;s requirements. Common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, or minimizing the number of vehicles used. In addition to satisfying customer demands, VRP often needs to consider various other constraints, leading to several variants. For example, if the vehicle&#x27;s load cannot exceed its maximum capacity, the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). If each customer&#x27;s delivery must be made within a specific time frame, the problem becomes the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic variant of the VRP. There are many real-world applications of VRPTW, as customer locations often have service time windows. For instance, some logistics centers need to stock parcels during off-peak hours, and large supermarkets need to replenish goods outside of business hours. Real-time delivery services like food delivery also require strict delivery time windows. Time windows can be categorized as hard or soft. A Hard Time Window (HTW) means that a vehicle must arrive at the delivery point within or before the time window; late arrivals are not permitted. If a vehicle arrives early, it must wait until the time window opens to begin service. This is common in scenarios like supermarket restocking and logistics center inbound operations. A Soft Time Window (STW) means that a vehicle is not strictly required to arrive within the time window, but it is encouraged to do so. A penalty is incurred for early or late arrivals. This is applicable in scenarios such as meal delivery, school bus services, and industrial deliveries.

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: within a region, there is a set of customer locations and a central depot. Vehicles must start from the depot and return to the depot, following continuous paths. Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle, and vehicles have a limited capacity. Each customer has a specific service time window, and service is only accepted within this window. A vehicle can arrive at a customer location early and wait for the time window to open, or it can arrive within the time window to provide service. Service can only begin within the time window, and the service duration is known. The distribution center must arrange an optimal delivery plan to both complete the delivery tasks and minimize travel costs. Because VRPHTW does not allow for delays, it, like the VRP, primarily emphasizes the minimization of travel costs along the routes.

 Now we consider a major enterprise logistics provider, &#x27;Global Logistics&#x27;, is responsible for providing precise material delivery services for multiple high-end office buildings and shops in a city&#x27;s central business district (CBD). Due to traffic control in the CBD and the specific receiving requirements of the customers, the delivery task is highly challenging.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Delivery Task**: There are 20 customers requiring delivery service on the day, and the demands of all customers must be met.
2.  **Vehicle Constraints**: The company can use at most 5 trucks, and the capacity of each truck is 200 units.
3.  **Capacity Constraint**: The total demand of all customers on a single route must not exceed the truck&#x27;s maximum capacity (200 units).
4.  **Time Window Constraint**: Each customer has a strict &#x27;hard time window.&#x27; Service must begin within this specified time window. Early arrivals must wait, and late arrivals are not permitted.
5.  **Service Time**: Due to the complex handover procedures at customer sites, a fixed service time of 90 minutes is required for unloading, handover, and paperwork at each customer location.
6.  **Optimization Objective**: While satisfying all constraints, the company&#x27;s objective is to **minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles** to reduce operational costs.

The labor force situation on the farm is 3,500 person-days in autumn and winter, and 4,000 person-days in spring and summer. If the labor force itself is not fully utilized, they can work externally, earning 2.1 yuan/person-day in spring and summer and 1.8 yuan/person-day in autumn and winter.

The farm cultivates three types of crops: soybeans, corn, and wheat, and also raises dairy cows and chickens. Crop cultivation requires no specialized investment, but raising animals involves an investment of 400 yuan per dairy cow and 3 yuan per chicken. Raising dairy cows requires allocating 1.5 hectares of land per cow to grow feed, and involves 100 person-days in autumn and winter, and 50 person-days in spring and summer per cow. The annual net income is 400 yuan per dairy cow. Raising chickens does not use land, requires 0.6 person-days in autumn and winter, and 0.3 person-days in spring and summer per chicken. Annual net income is 2 yuan per chicken. The current chicken coop can accommodate up to 3,000 chickens, and the cow barn can accommodate up to 32 dairy cows. The labor and income requirements for the three types of crops per year are shown in Table 1-9.

Month 2: 1000 m²
Month 3: 2000 m²
Month 4: 1200 m²

Warehouse space can be rented via contracts of fixed duration. A contract of length k months (k ? {1, 2, 3, 4}) may start at the beginning of any month t provided it ends no later than Month 4 (i.e., t + k ? 1 ? 4). A contract starting in month t covers months t through t + k ? 1. The rental fee is charged per square meter per month and depends on the contract length as follows:
1-month contract: 22 yuan per m² per month
2-month contract: 21 yuan per m² per month
3-month contract: 20 yuan per m² per month
4-month contract: 19 yuan per m² per month

Additional rules and assumptions:

You may sign any number of contracts.

Rented area is divisible (you may rent any nonnegative real number of m²).

Supply is unlimited at the listed rates.

In each month, the total active rented area must be at least the required area for that month.

You pay for the entire area specified in each contract for every month it is active, even if some capacity is unused.

It is known that apart from the purchased parts, the production of one microwave oven requires 2 hours of processing in workshop A and 1 hour of assembly in workshop B. The production of one water heater requires 1 hour of processing in workshop A and 3 hours of assembly in workshop B. After production, both products need inspection, sales, and other procedures. The inspection and sales cost for each microwave oven is 30 yuan, and for each water heater is 50 yuan. Workshop A has 250 hours of available production time per month, with each hour costing 80 yuan; workshop B has 150 hours of available production time per month, with each hour costing 20 yuan. It is estimated that an average of 80 microwave ovens and 50 water heaters can be sold per month next year. Based on these actual conditions, the company has established the following monthly plan constraints:

1. Inspection and sales costs should not exceed 5500 yuan per month;
2. At least 80 microwave ovens should be sold per month;
3. The production hours of both workshops A and B should be fully utilized;

Each pack of Meaties contains 2 pounds of grains and 3 pounds of meat; each pack of Yummies contains 3 pounds of grains and 1.5 pounds of meat. The company believes it can sell any quantity of dog food that it can produce. Meaties sell for $2.80 per pack, and Yummies sell for $2.00 per pack. The company&#x27;s production is subject to several constraints. First, a maximum of 400,000 pounds of grains can be purchased each month at a price of $0.20 per pound of grains. A maximum of 300,000 pounds of meat can be purchased each month at a price of $0.50 per pound of meat. Additionally, a special machine is required to produce Meaties, with a monthly capacity of 90,000 packs. The variable costs for mixing and packaging dog food are $0.25 per pack (Meaties) and $0.20 per pack (Yummies). Detailed information is provided in Table B-1.

Below is a bandwidth communication table between several communication nodes, showing the bandwidth between any two nodes. If two nodes cannot be directly connected, the corresponding bandwidth is $0$. It is required to establish a link between node $A$ and node $E$ that must pass through service node $C$ (without loops). The bandwidth of this link is defined as the minimum bandwidth value on the link. Please propose a reasonable link arrangement to maximize the bandwidth of this link and find out the maximum bandwidth.
