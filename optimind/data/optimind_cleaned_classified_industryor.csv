"['Production Planning Problem', 'Capacitated Lot-sizing Problem (CLSP)']","A factory produces two types of food, I and II, and currently has 50 skilled workers. It is known that one skilled worker can produce $10 \ \mathrm{kg} / \ \mathrm{h}$ of food I or $6 \ \mathrm{kg} / \ \mathrm{h}$ of food II. According to contract bookings, the weekly demand for these two foods will rise sharply, as shown in Table 1-11. Therefore, the factory has decided to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. It is known that a worker works $40 \ \mathrm{h}$ per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work $60 \ \mathrm{h}$ per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan. If the booked food cannot be delivered on time, the compensation fee for each week of delay per $ \ \mathrm{kg}$ is 0.5 yuan for food I and 0.6 yuan for food II. Under these conditions, how should the factory make comprehensive arrangements to minimize the total cost?

"['Capacitated Lot-sizing Problem (CLSP)', 'Production Planning Problem']","A company specializing in foldable tables needs to create an optimal production and human resources plan for a six-month period (January to June) to maximize its total net profit. The plan must detail monthly in-house production levels, outsourcing quantities, and workforce management (hiring/firing).

**Initial Conditions (at the start of January):**
- Initial Workforce: 1,000 employees
- Initial Inventory: 15,000 units

**Revenue and Cost Structure:**
- **Sales Price:** 300 Yuan per unit sold.
- **Raw Material Cost:** 90 Yuan per unit, applicable *only* to units produced in-house.
- **Outsourcing Cost:** 200 Yuan per unit for finished tables acquired from a third-party supplier. This is an all-inclusive cost.
- **Inventory Holding Cost:** 15 Yuan per unit for any inventory held at the end of a month.
- **Backorder Cost:** 35 Yuan per unit for any unfulfilled demand (stockout) carried over to the next month.

**Labor and Production Parameters:**
- **Labor Requirement:** Each in-house unit requires 5 labor hours to produce.
- **Regular Labor:** Each worker provides 160 regular working hours per month (8 hours/day * 20 days/month). The company pays a regular wage of 30 Yuan/hour for these 160 hours, regardless of full utilization.
- **Overtime Labor:** Workers can perform overtime. Total overtime hours per month for the entire workforce cannot exceed 20 hours per worker. The overtime wage is 40 Yuan/hour.
- **Workforce Management:** The company can hire or fire workers each month. The cost to hire a new worker is 5,000 Yuan, and the cost to fire a worker is 8,000 Yuan.

**Demand and Fulfillment Logic:**
- Unfulfilled demand from one month is back-ordered and must be met in subsequent months.
- The company fulfills orders (both current demand and backorders) using available inventory from the previous month, current in-house production, and outsourced units.

**Terminal Condition (at the end of June):**
- The ending inventory must be at least 10,000 units.
- All backorders must be cleared (i.e., ending backorders must be zero).

The production of any container type necessitates the use of its dedicated specialized equipment. If the decision is made to **activate** the production equipment for a particular container type (i.e., if the production quantity of that type is greater than zero), a fixed setup cost of 1200 Yuan is incurred for that specific equipment.

Should the production quantity of a certain container type be insufficient to meet its direct demand, the factory has the option to utilize other container types with **larger or equal volume** as substitutes to fulfill this unmet demand. For instance, type 2 containers (volume 2500 $\text{cm}^3$) can be used to satisfy the demand for type 1 containers (requiring a volume of 1500 $\text{cm}^3$), but type 1 containers cannot be used for type 2 demand. In this problem, the container type codes are pre-sorted in ascending order of their volumes.

['Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)'],"The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959. It is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can be described as follows: in a certain area, there is a number of customers and a distribution center or depot. Customers are generally located at different positions, and each has a specific demand for goods. The distribution center needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design appropriate delivery routes to fulfill the demands of all customers. The objective of VRP is to optimize a certain benefit metric while satisfying all customer demands. The benefit metric is usually presented as an objective function, which varies according to the company's requirements. Common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, or minimizing the number of vehicles used. In addition to satisfying customer demands, VRP often needs to consider various other constraints, leading to several variants. For example, if the vehicle's load cannot exceed its maximum capacity, the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). If each customer's delivery must be made within a specific time frame, the problem becomes the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic variant of the VRP. There are many real-world applications of VRPTW, as customer locations often have service time windows. For instance, some logistics centers need to stock parcels during off-peak hours, and large supermarkets need to replenish goods outside of business hours. Real-time delivery services like food delivery also require strict delivery time windows. Time windows can be categorized as hard or soft. A Hard Time Window (HTW) means that a vehicle must arrive at the delivery point within or before the time window; late arrivals are not permitted. If a vehicle arrives early, it must wait until the time window opens to begin service. This is common in scenarios like supermarket restocking and logistics center inbound operations. A Soft Time Window (STW) means that a vehicle is not strictly required to arrive within the time window, but it is encouraged to do so. A penalty is incurred for early or late arrivals. This is applicable in scenarios such as meal delivery, school bus services, and industrial deliveries.

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: within a region, there is a set of customer locations and a central depot. Vehicles must start from the depot and return to the depot, following continuous paths. Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle, and vehicles have a limited capacity. Each customer has a specific service time window, and service is only accepted within this window. A vehicle can arrive at a customer location early and wait for the time window to open, or it can arrive within the time window to provide service. Service can only begin within the time window, and the service duration is known. The distribution center must arrange an optimal delivery plan to both complete the delivery tasks and minimize travel costs. Because VRPHTW does not allow for delays, it, like the VRP, primarily emphasizes the minimization of travel costs along the routes.

 Now we consider a major enterprise logistics provider, 'Global Logistics', is responsible for providing precise material delivery services for multiple high-end office buildings and shops in a city's central business district (CBD). Due to traffic control in the CBD and the specific receiving requirements of the customers, the delivery task is highly challenging.

**Specific Requirements:**

1.  **Delivery Task**: There are 20 customers requiring delivery service on the day, and the demands of all customers must be met.
2.  **Vehicle Constraints**: The company can use at most 5 trucks, and the capacity of each truck is 200 units.
3.  **Capacity Constraint**: The total demand of all customers on a single route must not exceed the truck's maximum capacity (200 units).
4.  **Time Window Constraint**: Each customer has a strict 'hard time window.' Service must begin within this specified time window. Early arrivals must wait, and late arrivals are not permitted.
5.  **Service Time**: Due to the complex handover procedures at customer sites, a fixed service time of 90 minutes is required for unloading, handover, and paperwork at each customer location.
6.  **Optimization Objective**: While satisfying all constraints, the company's objective is to **minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles** to reduce operational costs.
