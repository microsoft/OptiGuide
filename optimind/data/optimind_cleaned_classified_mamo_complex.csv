"[""Diet Problem""]","Imagine you're a dietitian, tasked with planning a nutritious and balanced meal for an athlete. The athlete needs to maintain a high protein, moderate carb diet, with enough calories to sustain their intense training regimen. The goal is to meet these dietary requirements at the lowest cost possible. You have five different food items to choose from: Steak, Rice, Chicken, Iceberg Lettuce, and Almonds. Each of these foods contains varying amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and each comes with a specific cost.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the nutritional value of each food item and its cost:

- Steak: Offers a whopping 20 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 167 calories for $7.
- Rice: Provides 6 grams of protein, an impressive 29 grams of carbohydrates, and a hefty 275 calories for $8.
- Chicken: Packs 17 grams of protein, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 112 calories for only $2.
- Iceberg Lettuce: Contains only 1 gram of protein, 8 grams of carbohydrates, and 148 calories for $8.
- Almonds: Provide 10 grams of protein, 2 grams of carbohydrates, and a high 286 calories for just $2.

The athlete's daily dietary requirements are as follows: at least 83 grams of protein, 128 grams of carbohydrates, and 1686 calories.

Your challenge is to select a combination of these foods that meets the athletes' nutritional needs, while keeping the costs as low as possible. So, what is the lowest possible cost to meet these dietary requirements? You could only assign integral portions of each type of food.",[18.0]

"[""Network Optimization""]","In the heart of a bustling metropolis, an expansive network of waterways and canals forms the lifeline for its residents, connecting 9 critical distribution centers that manage the flow of water from the city's reservoirs to its farthest suburbs. This intricate system, designed to ensure the smooth and efficient delivery of water, consists of channels with varying capacities, reflecting the maximum volumes of water (in thousands of gallons per hour) that can traverse these connections without causing overflow or damage.

Here's a detailed look at the capacities of each channel in this vital network:

- From Distribution Center 0 (Source), the water can be directed to Centers 1 through 8 with capacities of 9, 7, 18, 0, 0, 7, 0, and 2 thousand gallons per hour, respectively.
- Center 1 has the capability to forward water to other centers, including sending 15, 11, 5, 20, 15, 18, 9, and 15 thousand gallons per hour to Centers 0 through 8 (excluding itself).
- Similarly, the capacities from Center 2 to others are marked by flows of 3, 8, 0, 10, 16, 18, 8, 0, and 20 thousand gallons per hour to Centers 0 through 8, respectively.
- The flow continues from Center 3 with capacities of 13, 3, 7, 0, 20, 13, 16, 6, and 20 thousand gallons per hour to the respective centers.
- From Center 4, water can be distributed with capacities of 7, 20, 2, 4, 0, 9, 3, 14, and 2 thousand gallons per hour.
- Center 5 allows for a distribution flow of 17, 10, 5, 1, 4, 0, 4, 3, and 20 thousand gallons per hour towards the respective centers.
- The network from Center 6 can support flows of 0, 20, 10, 10, 15, 5, 0, 1, and 10 thousand gallons per hour.
- From Center 7, water can be directed with capacities of 10, 3, 9, 4, 3, 13, 18, 0, and 20 thousand gallons per hour.
- Finally, Center 8 can send back or redistribute water with capacities of 2, 12, 10, 5, 15, 14, 0, 10, and 0 thousand gallons per hour to the respective centers.

In this network, a capacity of ""0"" indicates the absence of a direct channel between two centers, necessitating the redirection of flow through other centers to ensure connectivity.

Given this complex and dynamic system, the city's water management team faces the challenging task of determining the maximum volume of water that can be efficiently distributed from Distribution Center 0 (the source) to all other centers, culminating at the final node (Center 8) which represents the city's outskirts. This calculation is crucial for optimizing the water supply and meeting the growing needs of the city's population.

What is the maximum amount of water (in thousands of gallons per hour) that can be distributed from the source to the outskirts without exceeding the specified capacities of the channels in the network?",[43.0]

"[""Profit Maximization Problem""]","Star Oil Company is considering five different investment opportunities. The cash outflows and net present values (NPVs) (in millions of dollars) for each opportunity are given in Table 7. Specifically, Investment 1 has a time 0 cash outflow of $11 million and a time 1 cash outflow of $3 million, with an NPV of $13 million. Investment 2 requires a time 0 outflow of $53 million and a time 1 outflow of $6 million, yielding an NPV of $16 million. Investment 3 has smaller outflows of $5 million at both time 0 and time 1 and also an NPV of $16 million. Investment 4 asks for a time 0 outflow of $5 million and a minimal $1 million at time 1, with an NPV of $14 million. Lastly, Investment 5 requires a $29 million outflow at time 0 and a significant $34 million at time 1, resulting in the highest NPV of $39 million. Star Oil has $40 million available for investment at time 0, and it estimates that $20 million will be available for investment at time 1. Star Oil may purchase any fraction of each investment, in which case, the cash outflows and NPV are adjusted proportionally. For example, if Star Oil purchases one-fifth of investment 3, then a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 0, and a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 1. The one-fifth share of investment 3 would yield an NPV of (1/5)*16=3.2 million dollars or $3.2 million. Star Oil wants to maximize the NPV that can be obtained by investing in investments 1-5. The goal is to formulate an LP that will help achieve this objective. Assume that any funds left over at time 0 cannot be used at time 1. Find the maximum NPV in million dollars.",[57.4490172]

The demand during each of the next four quarters is as follows: first quarter, 40 sailboats; second quarter, 60 sailboats; third quarter, 75 sailboats; fourth quarter, 25 sailboats. Sailco must meet demands on time. At the beginning of the first quarter, Sailco has an inventory of 10 sailboats. At the beginning of each quarter, Sailco must decide how many sailboats should be produced during that quarter. For simplicity, we assume that sailboats manufactured during a quarter can be used to meet demand for that quarter. During each quarter, Sailco can produce up to 40 sailboats with regular-time labor at a total cost of $400 per sailboat. By having employees work overtime during a quarter, Sailco can produce additional sailboats with overtime labor at a total cost of $450 per sailboat. At the end of each quarter (after production has occurred and the current quarterâ€™s demand has been satisfied), a carrying or holding cost of $20 per sailboat is incurred. Use linear programming to determine a production schedule to minimize the sum of production and inventory costs during the next four quarters. Find the minimal sum.",[78450.0]
