['Job Shop'],"The manufacturing facility produces custom components for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, each consisting of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time (makespan) while satisfying all operational constraints. Job 0 has five operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 4 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 6 units, Operation 3 takes 6 units, and Operation 4 takes 8 units. Job 1 has four operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 9 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 4 units, and Operation 3 takes 2 units.

Precedence constraints ensure that operations within each job are performed in sequence with specific gaps. For Job 0, Operation 1 must start at least 4 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, Operation 3 must start at least 6 units after Operation 2 starts, and Operation 4 must start at least 6 units after Operation 3 starts. For Job 1, Operation 1 must start at least 9 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, and Operation 3 must start at least 4 units after Operation 2 starts.

Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap. In particular, there are 3 machines (M0, M1, M2). Operation 1 of Job 0, Operation 3 of Job 0, and Operation 2 of Job 1 are on machine M0. Operation 0of Job 0, Operation 2 of Job 0, and Operation 3 of Job 1 are on machine M1. Finally, Operation 4 of Job 0, Operation 0 of Job 1, and Operation 1 of Job 1 are on machine M2. Binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. Constraints apply to all operation pairs on shared machines, ensuring no overlap and maintaining required time gaps (one operation must finish before another can start). The large constant of 100,000 is used in these constraints to enforce the sequencing logic by ensuring that the constraints are only active when the binary variable is set to 1.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. Specifically, the makespan must be at least 4 units after Operation 0 of Job 0 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 2 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 3 of Job 0 starts, 8 units after Operation 4 of Job 0 starts, 9 units after Operation 0 of Job 1 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 1 starts, 4 units after Operation 2 of Job 1 starts, and 2 units after Operation 3 of Job 1 starts.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to minimize the makespan while respecting all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and the makespan definition. Binary variables are used to enforce the correct sequencing of operations on shared machines, with a large constant of 100,000 ensuring the constraints are properly applied. The start times for all operations and the makespan must be non-negative. The binary variables are explicitly defined for all relevant operation pairs on shared machines, and the start times and makespan are continuous variables.",25.0
['AircraftLanding'],"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of three aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times while ensuring safe separation between aircraft and adhering to their respective time windows. Each aircraft has an earliest and latest possible landing time, and penalty costs for landing earlier or later than their target landing time. Aircraft 0 has a target landing time of 231 minutes, an earliest landing time of 201 minutes, a latest landing time of 261 minutes, an early penalty cost of \$37 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \$73 per minute. Aircraft 1 has a target landing time of 264 minutes, an earliest landing time of 234 minutes, a latest landing time of 294 minutes, an early penalty cost of \$99 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \$84 per minute. Aircraft 2 has a target landing time of 59 minutes, an earliest landing time of 29 minutes, a latest landing time of 89 minutes, an early penalty cost of \$90 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \$56 per minute.

The separation requirements are enforced using binary decision variables that determine the order in which the aircraft land. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 11 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 27 minutes. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 9 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 232 minutes. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 9 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 265 minutes.

The landing time windows must be respected: Aircraft 0 must land between 201 and 261 minutes, Aircraft 1 between 234 and 294 minutes, and Aircraft 2 between 29 and 89 minutes. The penalties for early and late landings are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target landing time, multiplied by the respective penalty costs. The objective is to determine the optimal landing times for all three aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs while ensuring all separation and time window constraints are satisfied. The total penalty cost is the sum of the early and late penalties for all aircraft. The order in which the aircraft land affects the separation requirements and landing times, so the schedule must balance these costs to achieve the lowest total penalty. Binary decision variables are used to determine the order of aircraft landings, ensuring that the separation constraints are enforced correctly. The constraints also ensure that the landing times are within the specified windows and that the penalties for early and late landings are calculated accurately based on the deviations from the target landing times.",7410.0
['TravelingSalesman'],"A logistics company must deliver packages to four cities: City 0, City 1, City 2, and City 3, minimizing the total delivery cost while ensuring each city is visited exactly once and the route forms a continuous loop without subtours. The delivery costs between cities are as follows: City 0 to City 1 costs 616 units, City 0 to City 2 costs 567 units, City 0 to City 3 costs 143 units, City 1 to City 0 costs 388 units, City 1 to City 2 costs 947 units, City 1 to City 3 costs 628 units, City 2 to City 0 costs 495 units, City 2 to City 1 costs 650 units, City 2 to City 3 costs 604 units, City 3 to City 0 costs 77 units, City 3 to City 1 costs 630 units, and City 3 to City 2 costs 23 units. The company uses binary decision variables to indicate whether a route is used and assigns position variables to each city to prevent subtours. The position variable for City 0 is fixed at 0, while the position variables for City 1, City 2, and City 3 must be integers between 0 and 3. The objective is to minimize the total delivery cost, which is the sum of the costs of all selected routes, including the term 0 times the position variable for City 0. Constraints ensure each city is visited and departed exactly once. Subtour elimination is enforced by ensuring that if a route from City i to City j is used, the position of City j must be greater than the position of City i, except for City 0, which is fixed as the starting point. These constraints are implemented through specific relationships between the route variables and the position variables, guaranteeing the delivery route forms a single loop without smaller loops. The constraints also explicitly bound the position variables for City 1, City 2, and City 3 to be between 0 and 3, and ensure that the position variables are correctly related to the route variables to eliminate subtours.",1204.0
['Job Shop'],"The problem involves scheduling operations for three jobs (Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2) on shared machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations with specific processing times: Job 0 has two operations (Operation 0 takes 9 units of time, Operation 1 takes 8 units), Job 1 has three operations (Operation 0 takes 8 units, Operation 1 takes 8 units, Operation 2 takes 4 units), and Job 2 has four operations (Operation 0 takes 1 unit, Operation 1 takes 6 units, Operation 2 takes 4 units, Operation 3 takes 2 units). Operations within a job must follow a strict order, meaning each operation cannot start until the previous one in the same job has finished. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed after 9 units of time, Operation 1 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 1 has completed after 8 units of time, and Operation 2 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 1 of Job 1 has completed after 8 units of time. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 2 has completed after 1 unit of time, Operation 2 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 1 of Job 2 has completed after 6 units of time, and Operation 3 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 2 of Job 2 has completed after 4 units of time.

Certain operations from different jobs share the same machine and cannot overlap in time: Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, so one must finish before the other starts. Similarly, Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1 share a machine, and their schedules must not overlap. This also applies to the following additional pairs of operations: Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 3 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 3 of Job 2, and Operation 2 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 2.

To enforce these constraints, binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. A large constant (1000) is used in the constraints to ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. The binary variables are restricted to values of 0 or 1, and the start times of operations are continuous and non-negative.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, it must be at least 9 units of time (completion of Operation 0 of Job 0), 8 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 0), 8 units (completion of Operation 0 of Job 1), 8 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 1), 4 units (completion of Operation 2 of Job 1), 1 unit (completion of Operation 0 of Job 2), 6 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 2), 4 units (completion of Operation 2 of Job 2), and 2 units (completion of Operation 3 of Job 2).

The objective is to determine the start times for each operation on each machine such that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. This involves deciding the order of operations on shared machines and ensuring no overlaps, while respecting the processing times and sequence constraints of each job.",22.0
"['SupplyChain', 'Network Optimization']","Imagine you are managing a supply chain network for a company that operates across three key locations: **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2**. Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these nodes while minimizing the total cost of establishing connections and shipping products.

#### Supply and Demand:
- **Node 0** has a net supply of **236 units**, meaning it can provide this amount to other nodes.
- **Node 1** has a net demand of **29 units**, requiring this amount to be fulfilled from other nodes.
- **Node 2** has a net demand of **207 units**, which must also be met through shipments from other nodes.

#### Shipping Costs and Capacities:
To move goods between nodes, you must decide whether to establish a connection (which incurs a fixed cost) and how much to ship (which incurs a variable cost per unit). The costs and capacities for each possible connection are as follows:

1. **Node 0 to Node 1**:
   - Fixed cost to establish the connection: **$3,532**
   - Variable shipping cost per unit: **$45**
   - Maximum shipping capacity: **773 units**

2. **Node 0 to Node 2**:
   - Fixed cost: **$3,895**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$49**
   - Maximum capacity: **973 units**

3. **Node 1 to Node 0**:
   - Fixed cost: **$3,485**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$11**
   - Maximum capacity: **785 units**

4. **Node 1 to Node 2**:
   - Fixed cost: **$1,845**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$40**
   - Maximum capacity: **787 units**

5. **Node 2 to Node 0**:
   - Fixed cost: **$1,291**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$13**
   - Maximum capacity: **602 units**

6. **Node 2 to Node 1**:
   - Fixed cost: **$1,818**
   - Variable shipping cost: **$47**
   - Maximum capacity: **766 units**

#### Key Decisions:
- For each connection between nodes, you must decide whether to establish it (a binary decision: yes or no).
- For each established connection, you must determine the amount of goods to ship, ensuring it does not exceed the connection's capacity.

#### Objective:
Your goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes:
1. The fixed costs of establishing the necessary connections.
2. The variable shipping costs based on the amount of goods transported.

#### Constraints:
1. **Capacity Constraints**: The amount of goods shipped between any two nodes cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that connection. For example, if you decide to ship goods from **Node 0 to Node 1**, the shipment must be **773 units or less**.
2. **Flow Balance Constraints**: The total inflow and outflow of goods at each node must match its supply or demand. For example:
   - At **Node 0**, the total inflow from **Node 1** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 1** and **Node 2** must equal **236 units**.
   - At **Node 1**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 2** must equal **-29 units** (indicating a net demand).
   - At **Node 2**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 1** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 1** must equal **-207 units** (indicating a net demand).

#### Summary:
Your task is to determine the most cost-effective way to establish connections and ship goods between **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2** to meet the supply and demand requirements while minimizing the total cost. This involves balancing fixed and variable costs, adhering to capacity limits, and ensuring the flow of goods aligns with the needs of each node.",18640.0
['AircraftLanding'],"The problem involves scheduling the landing times of four aircraft (aircraft_0, aircraft_1, aircraft_2, aircraft_3) at an airport to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their earliest possible landing times while adhering to separation and timing constraints. Each aircraft has an earliest and latest possible landing time, and penalty costs for landing early or late.
Aircraft_0 has an earliest time of 0 minutes, latest time of 37 minutes, early penalty of \$61 per minute, and late penalty of \$82 per minute.
Aircraft_1 has an earliest time of 7 minutes, latest time of 67 minutes, early penalty of \$35 per minute, and late penalty of \$34 per minute.
Aircraft_2 has an earliest time of 225 minutes, latest time of 285 minutes, early penalty of \$74 per minute, and late penalty of \$41 per minute.
Aircraft_3 has an earliest time of 119 minutes, latest time of 179 minutes, early penalty of \$93 per minute, and late penalty of \$56 per minute.

The landing order between any two aircraft must be explicitly determined using binary decision variables, ensuring one lands before the other. Separation constraints are enforced based on these landing orders, with two different separation times for each unordered pair {i,j} depending on which aircraft lands first. The required separation times (in minutes) are:

• Pair (0,1):
 – If aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_1, separation = 30
 – If aircraft_1 lands before aircraft_0, separation = 2

• Pair (0,2):
 – If aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_2, separation = 30
 – If aircraft_2 lands before aircraft_0, separation = 2

• Pair (0,3):
 – If aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_3, separation = 30
 – If aircraft_3 lands before aircraft_0, separation = 2

• Pair (1,2):
 – If aircraft_1 lands before aircraft_2, separation = 20
 – If aircraft_2 lands before aircraft_1, separation = 3

• Pair (1,3):
 – If aircraft_1 lands before aircraft_3, separation = 25
 – If aircraft_3 lands before aircraft_1, separation = 4

• Pair (2,3):
 – If aircraft_2 lands before aircraft_3, separation = 15
 – If aircraft_3 lands before aircraft_2, separation = 2

These constraints ensure that the separation between consecutive landings is maintained according to the specific coefficients provided above.

Each aircraft should land within its specified earliest and latest possible landing times. Early deviations are calculated as the difference between the earliest time and the actual landing time if the aircraft lands early, and late deviations are calculated as the difference between the actual landing time and the earliest time if the aircraft lands late. The total penalty cost is the sum of the early and late penalties for all aircraft. The objective is to determine the optimal landing times for all four aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs while ensuring all separation and timing constraints are satisfied.",738.0
['AircraftLanding'],"The problem involves scheduling the landings of six aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times. Each aircraft has a target landing time, an earliest possible landing time, and a latest possible landing time.

– aircraft_1: 192
– aircraft_2: 293
– aircraft_3: 28
– aircraft_4: 150
– aircraft_5: 287

Penalties are incurred for landing early or late, with specific penalty rates for each aircraft: aircraft_0 has an early penalty rate of 72 and a late penalty rate of 59, aircraft_1 has an early penalty rate of 81 and a late penalty rate of 40, aircraft_2 has an early penalty rate of 46 and a late penalty rate of 34, aircraft_3 has an early penalty rate of 78 and a late penalty rate of 24, aircraft_4 has an early penalty rate of 40 and a late penalty rate of 80, and aircraft_5 has an early penalty rate of 60 and a late penalty rate of 14.

The landing times must respect minimum separation times between consecutive landings, which vary depending on the pair of aircraft. The required minimum separation times s_ij (in minutes, where i lands before j) are:

j → 0 1 2 3 4 5
i ↓
0 0 29 24 31 26 25

4 26 28 26 29 0 25
5 25 29 27 24 25 0

The separation constraints are enforced using binary decision variables that determine the order in which the aircraft land. The objective is to minimize the sum of early and late landing penalties, weighted by the respective penalty rates for each aircraft. The landing times must fall within the specified time windows for each aircraft: aircraft_0 must land between 221 and 281, aircraft_1 between 179 and 239, aircraft_2 between 268 and 300, aircraft_3 between 0 and 36, aircraft_4 between 131 and 191, and aircraft_5 between 265 and 300. The order of landings must ensure that the separation constraints are satisfied, with the specific separation times shown above for each pair of aircraft. The binary decision variables ensure that the separation constraints are met by determining the sequence of landings.

The problem requires determining the exact landing times for each aircraft within their respective time windows, ensuring that the separation requirements are met, and minimizing the total penalty costs. The binary variables are used to enforce the separation constraints, ensuring that if one aircraft lands before another, the required separation time is maintained. The constraints also ensure that the landing times fall within the specified time windows and that the penalties for early or late landings are correctly calculated based on the deviation from the target landing times. The binary variables are explicitly defined as binary (0 or 1) to determine the sequence of landings and enforce the separation constraints.",1078.0

Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and some operations require the use of shared machinery.

Job 0 has three operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, and Operation 2. Operation 1 must start at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 completes, and Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation 1 completes.

Some operations from both jobs require the use of the same machine, and only one operation can be processed on a machine at any given time. The following pairs of operations share the same machine: Operation 3 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 0 and Operation 1 of Job 0, Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1, and Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1. For each pair of operations sharing a machine, a decision must be made about which operation is processed first. This decision is represented by a binary variable, where a value of 1 indicates that the first operation in the pair is processed before the second, and a value of 0 indicates the opposite.

The primary objective is to minimize the total production time, or makespan, which is defined as the time at which the last operation across all jobs is completed. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation in both jobs.

Aircraft 0 must land between 24 and 84 minutes, Aircraft 1 between 180 and 240 minutes, and Aircraft 2 between 215 and 275 minutes.

The target landing times are defined such that Aircraft 0 should land at 54 minutes, Aircraft 1 should land at 210 minutes, and Aircraft 2 should land at 245 minutes. 

To ensure safe landings, separation times between aircraft must be maintained based on the order in which they land. Binary variables determine the order of landings between any two aircraft. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 5 minutes between their landings; if Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 96 minutes.

Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation requires a certain amount of time to complete. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operations are scheduled without overlapping on the same machine and that the sequence of operations within each job is respected.

Job 0 consists of two operations: Operation 0 takes 5 units of time to complete, and Operation 1 can only start after Operation 0 has finished. The makespan must be at least 5 units of time after the start of Operation 0 and at least 2 units of time after the start of Operation 1.

Job 1 consists of five operations: Operation 0 takes 9 units of time to complete, Operation 1 takes 9 units of time and can only start after Operation 0 has finished, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time and can only start after Operation 1 has finished, Operation 3 takes 2 units of time and can only start after Operation 2 has finished, and Operation 4 takes 8 units of time and can only start after Operation 3 has finished. The makespan must be at least 9 units of time after the start of Operation 0, at least 9 units of time after the start of Operation 1, at least 7 units of time after the start of Operation 2, at least 2 units of time after the start of Operation 3, and at least 8 units of time after the start of Operation 4.

Certain operations must be performed on the same machine, and their scheduling must avoid overlaps. 

The primary objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the total time taken to complete all operations across both jobs. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation in either job. All operations must start at or after time 0, and the order of operations within each job must be strictly followed. The scheduling of operations on shared machines must respect the no-overlap constraints described above. Binary variables are used to enforce the no-overlap constraints on the shared machines, ensuring that the operations do not overlap and the sequence constraints are satisfied.

['AircraftLanding'],"There are two aircraft, **aircraft_0** and **aircraft_1**, that need to be scheduled for landing. The goal is to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times. **aircraft_0** must land between 0 and 30 units of time, while **aircraft_1** must land between 128 and 188 units of time. The target landing time for **aircraft_0** is 0 units, and for **aircraft_1**, it is 158 units. Penalties are incurred for deviations from the target times: **aircraft_0** incurs a penalty of 42 units per unit time for landing early and 32 units per unit time for landing late, while **aircraft_1** incurs a penalty of 62 units per unit time for landing early and 55 units per unit time for landing late.

To ensure safety, a minimum separation time must be maintained between the landings of the two aircraft. If **aircraft_0** lands before **aircraft_1**, there must be at least 3 units of separation time. If **aircraft_1** lands before **aircraft_0**, there must be at least 98 units of separation time. The order of landings is determined by binary variables **AircraftOrder[aircraft_0,aircraft_1]** and **AircraftOrder[aircraft_1,aircraft_0]**, which are mutually exclusive and must sum to 1. The landing times must respect the separation requirements based on the landing order, and each aircraft must land within its specified time window.

The early and late deviations for each aircraft are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target time. For **aircraft_0**, the early deviation is non-negative, and the late deviation is non-negative. For **aircraft_1**, the early deviation is calculated as the difference between the target time and the actual landing time, and the late deviation is calculated as the difference between the actual landing time and the target time. The objective is to minimize the total penalty costs, which are calculated as the sum of the penalties for early and late deviations for both aircraft.",0.0
['Job Shop'],"The manufacturing facility produces custom parts for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, each with a sequence of operations that must follow specific precedence constraints.

Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0 with duration 4, Operation 1 with duration 2, Operation 2 with duration 1, Operation 3 with duration 3, and Operation 4 with duration 7. For each job, all of its operations need to be processed in order, and one operation can only start once the previous operation has been completed. In particular, for Job 0, Operation 1 must start at least 2 hours after Operation 0 begins. For Job 1, Operation 1 must start at least 4 hours after Operation 0 begins, Operation 2 must start at least 2 hours after Operation 1 begins, Operation 3 must start at least 1 hour after Operation 2 begins, and Operation 4 must start at least 3 hours after Operation 3 begins.

Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 7 units of time, Operation 2 takes 4 units of time, Operation 3 takes 3 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 2 units of time.

For example, in Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, and in Job 3, Operation 6 cannot start until Operation 5 has finished. No two operations can be processed on the same machine at the same time. For example, if Operation 3 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap, and the start time of one must be at least 4 units after the other, depending on the order in which they are scheduled. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3 cannot overlap on the same machine, and the start time of one must be at least 7 units after the other.

The total completion time (makespan) must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the makespan must be at least 2 units to account for the completion of Operation 0 in Job 0, and it must also be at least 9 units to account for the completion of Operation 6 in Job 3. The objective is to minimize the makespan, which involves determining the start times for each operation on each machine while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. All start times must be non-negative, and the order of operations on each machine is determined by binary decision variables, which decide whether one operation starts before another on the same machine.

['Job Shop'],"There are six jobs, each with a specific sequence of operations that must be performed on shared machines to complete their tasks. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all jobs. Each job has a predefined sequence of operations with specific processing times. Job 0 has two operations: the first takes 1 unit of time, and the second takes 6 units. Job 1 has two operations: the first takes 4 units, and the second takes 2 units. Job 2 has three operations: the first takes 9 units, the second takes 2 units, and the third takes 2 units. Job 3 has four operations: the first takes 5 units, the second takes 7 units, the third takes 6 units, and the fourth takes 3 units. Job 4 has four operations: the first takes 2 units, the second takes 9 units, the third takes 8 units, and the fourth takes 7 units. Job 5 has two operations: the first takes 4 units, and the second takes 8 units.

Operations from different jobs may share the same machine, and the order in which they are processed must be determined. For example, the second operation of Job 0 and the fourth operation of Job 3 share a machine. If Job 0’s second operation starts first, it must finish before Job 3’s fourth operation begins, or vice versa. Similarly, the second operation of Job 1 and the second operation of Job 2 share a machine. If Job 1’s second operation starts first, it must finish before Job 2’s second operation begins, or vice versa.

For Job 1, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For Job 2, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, and the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed.

For example, Job 0’s second operation must start at least 1 unit of time after the first operation starts. Job 1’s second operation must start at least 4 units of time after the first operation starts. Job 2’s second operation must start at least 9 units of time after the first operation starts, and the third operation must start at least 2 units of time after the second operation starts. Job 3’s second operation must start at least 5 units of time after the first operation starts, the third operation must start at least 7 units of time after the second operation starts, and the fourth operation must start at least 6 units of time after the third operation starts. Job 4’s second operation must start at least 2 units of time after the first operation starts, the third operation must start at least 9 units of time after the second operation starts, and the fourth operation must start at least 8 units of time after the third operation starts. Job 5’s second operation must start at least 4 units of time after the first operation starts.

Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The processing times for each operation are as follows: Job 0 has Operation 0 (6 units), Operation 1 (8 units), and Operation 2 (9 units); Job 1 has Operation 0 (3 units), Operation 1 (8 units), Operation 2 (5 units), Operation 3 (5 units), and Operation 4 (2 units); Job 2 has Operation 0 (8 units), Operation 1 (1 unit), and Operation 2 (6 units); Job 3 has Operation 0 (1 unit), Operation 1 (9 units), Operation 2 (4 units), and Operation 3 (5 units).

Each machine can process only one operation at a time. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order of operations on the same machine is determined by binary decision variables. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 1 are on the same machine, the binary variable determines whether Operation 0 of Job 0 is processed before Operation 3 of Job 1 or vice versa. Similar constraints apply to other operation pairs on the same machine, such as Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3, and Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 3.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, which must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation.

For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed, which takes at least 6 units. Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap, with binary variables determining the order of operations on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, and all start times for operations must be non-negative. Binary variables must be either 0 or 1, determining the order of operations on the same machine.

The goal is to find the optimal schedule that meets all these constraints while minimizing the total time required to complete all jobs.

ADDITIONAL INPUT DATA:

1) Sets and indices
- Jobs: J = {0, 1, 2, 3}
- For each job j in J, operations are indexed sequentially starting at 0. We denote operation (j,k) for job j and operation index k.
- Machines: M = {0, 1, 2}  # machines are indexed 0..2

2) Machine assignment for every operation (explicit mapping)
- Job 0: Operation (0,0) -> Machine 0
- Job 0: Operation (0,1) -> Machine 1
- Job 0: Operation (0,2) -> Machine 2

- Job 1: Operation (1,0) -> Machine 0
- Job 1: Operation (1,1) -> Machine 1
- Job 1: Operation (1,2) -> Machine 2
- Job 1: Operation (1,3) -> Machine 1
- Job 1: Operation (1,4) -> Machine 2

- Job 2: Operation (2,0) -> Machine 2
- Job 2: Operation (2,1) -> Machine 0
- Job 2: Operation (2,2) -> Machine 1

- Job 3: Operation (3,0) -> Machine 0
- Job 3: Operation (3,1) -> Machine 2
- Job 3: Operation (3,2) -> Machine 1
- Job 3: Operation (3,3) -> Machine 2

3) Processing durations (explicit list matching the original description)
- Job 0: durations = [6, 8, 9]
- Job 1: durations = [3, 8, 5, 5, 2]
- Job 2: durations = [8, 1, 6]
- Job 3: durations = [1, 9, 4, 5]",38.0
"['Multicommodity Capacitated Network Design', 'Network Optimization']","Imagine you are managing a supply chain network for a company that operates across six key locations (nodes). Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these locations while minimizing the total cost, which includes both fixed costs for establishing connections and variable costs for shipping goods.

#### Supply and Demand:
- **Location 0** has a demand of 116 units.
- **Location 1** has a demand of 134 units.
- **Location 2** has no net supply or demand (balance is 0).
- **Location 3** has a demand of 141 units.
- **Location 4** has a demand of 8 units.
- **Location 5** has a demand of 101 units.

#### Costs and Capacities:
To establish a connection between any two locations, there is a fixed cost. Additionally, shipping goods between locations incurs a variable cost per unit. Each connection also has a maximum capacity, limiting the amount of goods that can be shipped.

Here are the specific costs and capacities for each possible connection:

- **Fixed Costs (for establishing connections):**
  - From Location 0: To Location 1 costs 1972, to Location 2 costs 2030, to Location 3 costs 2048, to Location 4 costs 1951, to Location 5 costs 2043.
  - From Location 1: To Location 0 costs 1993, to Location 2 costs 2029, to Location 3 costs 1975, to Location 4 costs 1967, to Location 5 costs 2026.
  - From Location 2: To Location 0 costs 2042, to Location 1 costs 1973, to Location 3 costs 2001, to Location 4 costs 2034, to Location 5 costs 2035.
  - From Location 3: To Location 0 costs 2007, to Location 1 costs 1968, to Location 2 costs 2004, to Location 4 costs 1996, to Location 5 costs 1969.
  - From Location 4: To Location 0 costs 1973, to Location 1 costs 1955, to Location 2 costs 2038, to Location 3 costs 1953, to Location 5 costs 2000.
  - From Location 5: To Location 0 costs 1999, to Location 1 costs 2031, to Location 2 costs 2011, to Location 3 costs 1965, to Location 4 costs 1984.

- **Variable Costs (per unit shipped):**
  - From Location 0: To Location 1 costs 21, to Location 2 costs 19, to Location 3 costs 20, to Location 4 costs 21, to Location 5 costs 21.
  - From Location 1: To Location 0 costs 21, to Location 2 costs 19, to Location 3 costs 21, to Location 4 costs 19, to Location 5 costs 20.
  - From Location 2: To Location 0 costs 20, to Location 1 costs 20, to Location 3 costs 21, to Location 4 costs 21, to Location 5 costs 20.
  - From Location 3: To Location 0 costs 19, to Location 1 costs 19, to Location 2 costs 20, to Location 4 costs 19, to Location 5 costs 20.
  - From Location 4: To Location 0 costs 20, to Location 1 costs 19, to Location 2 costs 20, to Location 3 costs 20, to Location 5 costs 19.
  - From Location 5: To Location 0 costs 21, to Location 1 costs 20, to Location 2 costs 20, to Location 3 costs 19, to Location 4 costs 21.

- **Maximum Capacities (units that can be shipped):**
  - From Location 0: To Location 1 can handle up to 137 units, to Location 2 up to 154 units, to Location 3 up to 189 units, to Location 4 up to 188 units, to Location 5 up to 247 units.
  - From Location 1: To Location 0 up to 163 units, to Location 2 up to 197 units, to Location 3 up to 242 units, to Location 4 up to 191 units, to Location 5 up to 135 units.
  - From Location 2: To Location 0 up to 226 units, to Location 1 up to 155 units, to Location 3 up to 182 units, to Location 4 up to 189 units, to Location 5 up to 160 units.
  - From Location 3: To Location 0 up to 179 units, to Location 1 up to 232 units, to Location 2 up to 210 units, to Location 4 up to 146 units, to Location 5 up to 241 units.
  - From Location 4: To Location 0 up to 238 units, to Location 1 up to 164 units, to Location 2 up to 238 units, to Location 3 up to 218 units, to Location 5 up to 195 units.
  - From Location 5: To Location 0 up to 237 units, to Location 1 up to 191 units, to Location 2 up to 165 units, to Location 3 up to 133 units, to Location 4 up to 191 units.

#### Objective:
Your task is to determine which connections to establish and how much to ship between locations to meet all demand requirements while minimizing the total cost. The total cost includes both the fixed costs of establishing connections and the variable costs of shipping goods.

#### Constraints:
1. **Capacity Constraints:** The amount of goods shipped between any two locations cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that connection.
2. **Flow Balance:** The total amount of goods entering a location minus the total amount leaving must equal the net supply or demand at that location.
3. **Binary Decisions:** For each connection, you must decide whether to establish it (yes or no), which incurs the fixed cost.

By carefully analyzing these factors, you aim to find the most cost-effective way to manage the supply chain network, ensuring all locations receive the goods they need without exceeding capacity limits or incurring unnecessary costs.",13033.0
"['Facility Location Problem', 'Set Cover']","You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. The goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

For each of the 29 available cell tower locations (tower_0 to tower_28), you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build). For each of the 33 regions (region_0 to region_32), you must decide whether the region will be covered by at least one active cell tower (a binary decision: cover or not cover).

The objective is to maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the regions are as follows: Region 0: 4,901; Region 1: 2,727; Region 2: 2,994; Region 3: 2,984; Region 4: 3,693; Region 5: 2,615; Region 6: 3,354; Region 7: 4,965; Region 8: 4,223; Region 9: 4,738; Region 10: 2,345; Region 11: 3,915; Region 12: 4,068; Region 13: 2,613; Region 14: 3,140; Region 15: 4,894; Region 16: 3,503; Region 17: 3,733; Region 18: 4,275; Region 19: 3,795; Region 20: 3,803; Region 21: 3,497; Region 22: 2,403; Region 23: 3,441; Region 24: 3,116; Region 25: 2,091; Region 26: 4,494; Region 27: 3,593; Region 28: 2,090; Region 29: 3,397; Region 30: 3,973; Region 31: 2,362; Region 32: 2,068.

#### **Objective:**
Your task is to determine the optimal amount of goods to ship between each pair of cities to meet all demands and supplies while minimizing the total transportation cost. The total cost is calculated by summing the cost of shipping goods across all routes, weighted by the amount shipped on each route.

#### **Constraints:**
1. **Flow Balance:** For each city, the total amount of goods shipped into the city plus its own supply must equal the total amount shipped out of the city plus its demand.
2. **Capacity Limits:** The amount of goods shipped on any route cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that route.
3. **Non-Negativity:** The amount of goods shipped on any route must be zero or positive.

By carefully planning the shipments, you aim to ensure that all cities receive the goods they need while keeping the total transportation costs as low as possible.",875.0

['Job Shop'],"The problem involves scheduling six jobs, labeled Job 0 through Job 5, in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in a specific sequence. The goal is to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, by determining the start times for all operations and the order of operations on shared machines. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a strict sequence, meaning the second operation cannot start until the first operation has completed. Certain operations are assigned to the same machine, and these operations cannot overlap in time. To enforce this, binary decision variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 1 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 3 on the same machine, the start time of Operation 1 of Job 3 must be at least 1 unit of time after the completion of Operation 1 of Job 1. The makespan is defined as the maximum completion time across all operations, and it must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that each operation starts only after the previous operation in the same job has completed; machine capacity constraints, ensuring that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap; and non-negativity constraints, ensuring that all start times are non-negative. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed as quickly as possible. The binary decision variables, such as those determining the order of Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 3, are critical in enforcing the machine capacity constraints. The numerical parameters include a large constant (1000) used in the constraints involving binary variables to ensure the correct sequencing of operations on shared machines. The start times and the makespan are general variables that can take on any real value within the bounds defined by the constraints.

['Job Shop'],"The problem involves scheduling 7 jobs, each consisting of 2 operations, on a set of machines to minimize the total production time, or makespan. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a specific sequence: operation 0 must be completed before operation 1 can begin. Some operations from different jobs are assigned to the same machine, and the machine can only process one operation at a time. The order in which operations are scheduled on a shared machine is determined by binary decision variables, which take a value of 1 if one operation is scheduled before another and 0 otherwise. A large constant of 100 is used to enforce that operations on the same machine do not overlap in time. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, ensuring it accounts for the longest-running job. Start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the binary variables must be either 0 or 1. The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the order in which operations are processed on shared machines to minimize the makespan while respecting the sequence of operations within each job and ensuring no overlaps on shared machines.

"['Job Shop', 'Flow Shop Scheduling']","There are five clients, labeled Client 0 to Client 4, each requiring two operations to be performed in sequence. Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The operations for each client must follow a strict sequence: the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, with a minimum gap of 1 unit of time between them. Operations from different clients may need to be performed on the same machine, and no two operations can overlap on the same machine. To enforce this, binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, which is the time when the last operation across all clients is completed. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of every operation. Start times for all operations are continuous variables, and the binary variables ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. A large number (1000) is used in the constraints to enforce the scheduling logic, ensuring that one operation finishes before another starts on the same machine. The problem involves determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to minimize the total production time while satisfying all constraints.

The required separation times between aircraft pairs are as follows: between aircraft 0 and 1, 7 units if aircraft 0 lands first or 8 units if aircraft 1 lands first; between aircraft 0 and 2, 6 units if aircraft 0 lands first or 7 units if aircraft 2 lands first; between aircraft 0 and 3, 5 units if aircraft 0 lands first or 8 units if aircraft 3 lands first; between aircraft 0 and 4, 5 units if aircraft 0 lands first or 7 units if aircraft 4 lands first; between aircraft 1 and 2, 5 units if aircraft 1 lands first or 6 units if aircraft 2 lands first; between aircraft 1 and 3, 5 units if aircraft 1 lands first or 7 units if aircraft 3 lands first; between aircraft 1 and 4, 6 units if aircraft 1 lands first or 5 units if aircraft 4 lands first; between aircraft 2 and 3, 5 units if aircraft 2 lands first or 6 units if aircraft 3 lands first; between aircraft 2 and 4, 5 units if aircraft 2 lands first or 7 units if aircraft 4 lands first; between aircraft 3 and 4, 6 units if aircraft 3 lands first or 6 units if aircraft 4 lands first.

The order in which aircraft land must be determined, and for each pair of aircraft, one must land before the other. The separation time must be enforced based on the landing order. The actual landing times for each aircraft must be determined, and the penalties for landing early or late must be calculated based on the deviations from the target landing times.

['Facility Dispersion Problem'],"Facility Location for Maximum Dispersion

You are tasked with selecting a set of facilities from a network of five potential locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the weighted distances between pairs of facilities, where higher weights indicate greater desirability for separation. The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible, given the constraints.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Facility Selection**: Decide which facilities to open. Each facility can either be selected (1) or not selected (0). Specifically, you must select exactly 2 facilities out of the 5 available.
2. **Pairwise Dispersion**: Determine whether a pair of facilities contributes to the dispersion score. A pair contributes only if both facilities in the pair are selected.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion score, which is the sum of the weighted distances between all pairs of selected facilities. The weights for each pair are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 22  
- Node 0 and Node 2: 19  
- Node 0 and Node 3: 24  
- Node 0 and Node 4: 22  
- Node 1 and Node 0: 19  
- Node 1 and Node 2: 23  
- Node 1 and Node 3: 16  
- Node 1 and Node 4: 25  
- Node 2 and Node 0: 19  
- Node 2 and Node 1: 16  
- Node 2 and Node 3: 19  
- Node 2 and Node 4: 21  
- Node 3 and Node 0: 25  
- Node 3 and Node 1: 19  
- Node 3 and Node 2: 21  
- Node 3 and Node 4: 17  
- Node 4 and Node 0: 19  
- Node 4 and Node 1: 22  
- Node 4 and Node 2: 19  
- Node 4 and Node 3: 21  

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected from the 5 available. This means the sum of the selection decisions for all facilities must equal 2.
2. **Pairwise Contribution Rules**:
   - A pair of facilities can only contribute to the dispersion score if both facilities in the pair are selected.
   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the pair cannot contribute to the dispersion score.
   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the pair must contribute to the dispersion score.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The weights for each pair of facilities are explicitly provided in the objective section above.
- The total number of facilities to select is fixed at 2.

#### Summary:
Your task is to select 2 facilities out of 5 such that the total dispersion score, calculated as the sum of the weighted distances between all selected pairs, is maximized. The selection must adhere to the constraints that ensure only valid pairs contribute to the dispersion score and that exactly 2 facilities are chosen.",49.0
['Job Shop'],"The problem involves scheduling production tasks for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of a sequence of 2 operations that must be performed in sequential order, with each operation taking exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and certain operations from different jobs may require the same machine. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operational constraints are satisfied.

Each operation within a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished. Operations that require the same machine cannot overlap in time. To enforce this, binary decision variables are used to determine the order of operations on each machine. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on Machine 1, the binary variable \( X_{(0,0),(1,0)} \) is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100) is used in the constraints to ensure that the sequencing is properly enforced.

The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 4 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10. All operation start times must be non-negative, and the binary decision variables can only take values of 0 or 1.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines such that the total production time is minimized. This must be done while ensuring that all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and non-negativity constraints are satisfied. The processing time for each operation is fixed at 1 unit of time, and the binary decision variables are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.


Additional information: 
- There are 3 machines, numbered from 0 to 2
- The assignment or operations to machines is the following:
	- Operation 0 of Job 0: Machine 1
	- Operation 1 of Job 0: Machine 0
	- Operation 0 of Job 1: Machine 2
	- Operation 1 of Job 1: Machine 0
	- Operation 0 of Job 2: Machine 1
	- Operation 1 of Job 2: Machine 0
	- Operation 0 of Job 3: Machine 1
	- Operation 1 of Job 3: Machine 2
	- Operation 0 of Job 4: Machine 2
	- Operation 1 of Job 4: Machine 1",4.0

Each location has the potential to host a facility, but due to budget constraints, you can only select **exactly 3 locations** to establish facilities. The goal is to maximize the total benefit generated by the interactions between the selected facilities.

#### Key Details:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must choose exactly 3 out of the 5 locations to establish facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
2. **Interaction Benefits**: The benefit of interaction between any two facilities depends on the specific pair of locations. For example:
   - If facilities are placed at Node 0 and Node 1, the interaction benefit is **16**.
   - If facilities are placed at Node 0 and Node 2, the interaction benefit is **20**.
   - Similarly, the interaction benefits for all other pairs are provided in the table below.

3. **Interaction Rules**:
   - An interaction benefit is only counted if **both facilities in the pair are selected**. For example, if Node 0 and Node 1 are both selected, the interaction benefit of 16 is added to the total.

5. **Constraints**:
   - **Facility Selection Constraint**: Exactly 3 facilities must be selected out of the 5 locations.
   - **Interaction Constraints**: For each pair of locations, the interaction benefit is only counted if both facilities in the pair are selected. This is enforced by ensuring that:
     - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the interaction benefit for that pair is not counted.
     - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the interaction benefit is fully counted.

6. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the total interaction benefit across all selected facility pairs.

#### Example:

- Node 0 & Node 1: 16
- Node 0 & Node 2: 20
- Node 1 & Node 2: 24

#### Objective:
Your objective is to determine the optimal amount of resources to transport between each pair of cities to minimize the total transportation cost while ensuring that all demands are met and all constraints are satisfied.

This problem requires careful planning to balance the supply and demand across the network, respecting the capacity limits of both the transportation links and the cities themselves. The solution will provide the most cost-effective way to distribute resources across the cities.",10.0
"['Minimum Cost Flow Problem', 'Network Optimization']","The problem involves determining the most cost-effective way to transport medical supplies across a network of 10 hospitals (node_0 to node_9) while minimizing total transportation costs. Each hospital is interconnected, and the cost of transporting supplies between any two hospitals varies. The decision variables are binary, representing whether a route between two hospitals is used (1) or not (0). The objective is to minimize the total cost of transporting supplies, calculated as the sum of the costs of all activated routes.

The constraints ensure that the supply balance is maintained across all hospitals. Specifically, node_0 must have a net supply of +1, indicating it is the source of supplies, while node_9 must have a net supply of -1, indicating it is the destination. All intermediate hospitals (node_1 to node_8) must have a net supply of 0, meaning they neither gain nor lose supplies overall. The flow balance constraints ensure that the total flow into each hospital equals the total flow out of it, with the exception of node_0 and node_9, which have specific net supply requirements. All decision variables are binary, meaning routes are either fully used or not used at all. The goal is to find the set of routes that satisfies these constraints while minimizing the total transportation cost.

['AircraftLanding'],"Minimize the total penalty costs associated with landing five aircraft either earlier or later than their target times, while ensuring safe separation between consecutive landings. Each aircraft has a target landing time, earliest and latest possible landing times, and penalties for landing early or late.

['Capacitated Lot-sizing Problem (CLSP)'],"You are managing a manufacturing facility that produces three types of products (Product 0, Product 1, and Product 2) using two machines (Machine 0 and Machine 1) over three time periods (Period 0, Period 1, and Period 2). Your goal is to minimize the total operational costs, which include production setup costs, machine startup costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs, while meeting customer demand for each product in each period.

For each product, machine, and time period, decide whether to produce the product and how much to produce. For each machine and time period, decide whether to start up the machine to begin production. For each product and time period, decide how much inventory to carry over to the next period or how much demand to backlog if production falls short.

Minimize the total cost, which includes production setup costs of 145.4242073380383 per production decision, machine startup costs of 79.18604813454679 per startup decision, inventory holding costs of 0.9008900951620358 for Product 0, 1.068925395295676 for Product 1, and 1.066244796883431 for Product 2 per unit per period, and backlogging costs of 6.734178682720012 for Product 0, 7.442225721133133 for Product 1, and 7.104627209109436 for Product 2 per unit per period.

For each product and time period, the total production across machines, plus any inventory carried over from the previous period, minus any backlog from the previous period, must equal the demand for that period plus the current inventory minus the current backlog. The demands for each product and period are as follows: Product 0: Period 0 = 20.33410585875594, Period 1 = 22.57961652322203, Period 2 = 15.89714240515548; Product 1: Period 0 = 24.05647618194615, Period 1 = 20.36522893983323, Period 2 = 17.47466293074195; Product 2: Period 0 = 16.36553930950429, Period 1 = 22.7831030020558, Period 2 = 19.7805033393852.

For each machine and time period, the production quantity multiplied by -71.79935969683524 for Machine 0 or -73.09691843304661 for Machine 1, plus the startup time multiplied by 6.342821301312698 for Machine 0 or 6.171760083826499 for Machine 1, plus the amount produced must be less than or equal to zero. Each machine can only produce one product at a time in any given period, meaning the sum of production decisions across all products for a given machine and period must be less than or equal to 1.

If a machine is producing a product in a period but was not producing it in the previous period, a startup decision must be made. Production quantities, inventory levels, and backlogs must be non-negative. Production and startup decisions are binary (either 0 or 1).",919.3047225564642
['Job Shop'],"There are 5 jobs, labeled Job 0 to Job 4, each consisting of 2 operations. Each operation must be performed on a specific machine, and the order of operations within a job is fixed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 must be completed before Operation 2 of Job 0 can begin. The processing time for each operation is 1 unit of time. The facility has a limited number of machines, and some operations from different jobs must be performed on the same machine. To avoid conflicts, no two operations can be scheduled on the same machine at the same time. This requires determining the order in which operations are processed on each machine. For example, Operations from Job 1 and Job 2 both require Machine 1, and you must decide whether to process Job 1's operation before Job 2's, or vice versa. Similarly, Operations from Job 4 and Job 0 must be sequenced on Machine 2. Binary variables are used to indicate whether one operation is scheduled before another on the same machine, ensuring that the scheduling constraints are satisfied. The primary objective is to minimize the makespan, which is the total time required to complete all jobs, determined by the latest completion time among all operations. For example, if the last operation finishes at time 10, the makespan is 10. Constraints include precedence constraints, ensuring each operation within a job starts only after the previous operation in the same job has finished; machine capacity constraints, ensuring operations sharing the same machine do not overlap in time; makespan definition, ensuring the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation; non-negativity constraints, ensuring all operation start times are non-negative; and binary variables, determining the order of operations on shared machines. The processing time for each operation is 1 unit of time, and binary variables are used with a large constant (1000) to enforce sequencing constraints. For example, if a binary variable is 1, then one operation must finish before another starts on the same machine. The task is to determine the start times for all operations across all jobs, ensuring operations within the same job are performed in the correct sequence, operations sharing the same machine do not overlap, and the total completion time is minimized.

['Job Shop'],"Job Shop Scheduling in a Manufacturing Facility

You are managing a manufacturing facility that produces custom parts for various clients. The facility has multiple machines, each capable of performing specific operations. There are seven jobs (Job 0 to Job 6) that need to be processed, and each job consists of 2 operations that must be performed in a specific order. All operations take 1 time unit.

#### Objective:
Your goal is to minimize the **makespan**, which is the total time required to complete all jobs. This ensures that all jobs are finished as quickly as possible, allowing the facility to meet client deadlines and optimize resource utilization.

#### Decisions to Be Made:
1. **Start Times**: Determine the start time for each operation of every job.
2. **Operation Order**: Decide the order in which operations are processed on each machine, ensuring no overlaps.

#### Constraints:
1. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - Each operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has been completed. For example:
     - Operation 1 of Job 0 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished.
     - Operation 1 of Job 1 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 1 has finished.
     - This pattern applies to all jobs and their respective operations.

2. **Machine Capacity Constraints**:
   - Certain additional pairs of operations also cannot overlap in time. These additional pairs are:
       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 4.
       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 6.
       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 4.
       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1.
       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2.
       - Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 3.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 3.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 3.
       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 5.
       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 6.
       - Operation 1 of Job 5 and Operation 0 of Job 6.

3. **Makespan Definition**:
   - The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation

4. **Non-Negativity**:
   - All start times must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero.

5. **Binary Variables**:
   - Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example:
     - A binary variable decides whether Operation 1 of Job 3 is processed before or after Operation 0 of Job 4 on the same machine.
     - Similar binary variables are used for all relevant pairs of operations sharing the same machine.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The large constant \( N = 100 \) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the binary variables correctly enforce the order of operations.

#### Summary:
Your task is to schedule the start times of all operations across all jobs and machines in such a way that the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. You must ensure that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the makespan reflects the latest completion time of any operation. The use of binary variables is critical to determining the correct order of operations on shared machines.",6.0
['Job Shop'],"The problem involves scheduling operations for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence, with the second operation starting only after the first operation is completed. All operations have a processing time of 1 unit. Operations from different jobs may share the same machine, and each machine can handle only one operation at a time. The goal is to minimize the total time required to complete all jobs, known as the makespan.

The start time of each operation must be determined, ensuring that the sequence of operations within each job is respected and that no two operations on the same machine overlap. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2 are on the same machine, a binary variable indicates whether Operation 0 of Job 0 precedes Operation 0 of Job 2 or vice versa. A large constant (100) is used in the constraints to enforce the correct ordering of operations on shared machines.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. The constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that the start time of the second operation is at least 1 unit after the completion of the first operation. Machine capacity constraints ensure that two operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap in time. The solution will provide a schedule that ensures all jobs are completed as quickly as possible, respecting the constraints of machine availability and operation precedence.

Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in a specific order, with the second operation starting only after the first operation is completed. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit. The goal is to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, by scheduling operations on the machines efficiently.

Each operation is assigned to a specific machine, and some operations from different jobs share the same machine, creating potential conflicts. To resolve these conflicts, the scheduler must determine the order in which operations are processed on each machine. This is achieved using binary variables, where a value of 1 indicates that one operation is scheduled before another, and 0 indicates the opposite.

['Facility Dispersion Problem'],"You are tasked with optimizing the placement of facilities across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the weighted distances between pairs of facilities, where the weights represent the importance or benefit of separating specific pairs. Your goal is to select exactly three facilities out of the five possible locations while ensuring that the total dispersion benefit is maximized.

#### Key Decisions:
- **Facility Selection:** Decide which three out of the five locations will host the facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
- **Pairwise Dispersion Activation:** Determine whether the dispersion benefit between a pair of selected facilities is activated. This is represented by a binary decision (1 if both facilities in the pair are selected, 0 otherwise).

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion benefit across all pairs of selected facilities. The dispersion benefit between each pair of locations is as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 17 units
- Node 0 and Node 2: 18 units
- Node 0 and Node 3: 21 units
- Node 0 and Node 4: 22 units

- Node 4 and Node 0: 24 units
- Node 4 and Node 1: 16 units
- Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units
- Node 4 and Node 3: 23 units

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit:** Exactly three facilities must be selected out of the five locations. This means the sum of selected facilities must equal three.
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation Rules:**
   - The dispersion benefit between two locations can only be activated if both locations are selected.
   - If either location in a pair is not selected, the dispersion benefit for that pair cannot be activated.
   - If both locations in a pair are selected, the dispersion benefit must be activated.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The dispersion benefits between each pair of locations are explicitly provided in the objective description above.
- The total number of facilities to be selected is fixed at three.

#### Practical Implications:
This problem ensures that the selected facilities are spread out in a way that maximizes their overall separation benefit, which could be critical in scenarios such as minimizing risk, optimizing coverage, or ensuring redundancy. The constraints ensure that the solution is both feasible and aligned with the operational requirements of selecting exactly three facilities.

By solving this problem, you will determine the optimal set of three facilities and the corresponding pairwise dispersion benefits that maximize the total separation value across the network.",135.0

   - Week 1: \$19, Week 2: \$16, Week 3: \$24, Week 4: \$23, Week 5: \$24, Week 6: \$23, Week 7: \$20, Week 8: \$21, Week 9: \$21, Week 10: \$25, Week 11: \$15, Week 12: \$20, Week 13: \$24, Week 14: \$16, Week 15: \$16, Week 16: \$16, Week 17: \$19, Week 18: \$15, Week 19: \$20.

4. **Backlogging Costs**: If demand cannot be met in a given week, the unmet demand is backlogged to the next week, incurring a cost per backlogged unit. These costs are:
   - Week 1: \$55, Week 2: \$54, Week 3: \$71, Week 4: \$58, Week 5: \$51, Week 6: \$55, Week 7: \$45, Week 8: \$52, Week 9: \$60, Week 10: \$52, Week 11: \$52, Week 12: \$52, Week 13: \$76, Week 14: \$50, Week 15: \$47, Week 16: \$66, Week 17: \$70, Week 18: \$48, Week 19: \$69.

#### **Demand Constraints:**
- The demand for each week must be met either by the inventory on hand, the units ordered in that week, or by backlogging to the next week. The demand for each week is as follows:
  - Week 1: 495 units, Week 2: 316 units, Week 3: 375 units, Week 4: 467 units, Week 5: 418 units, Week 6: 398 units, Week 7: 533 units, Week 8: 525 units, Week 9: 361 units, Week 10: 452 units, Week 11: 470 units, Week 12: 378 units, Week 13: 302 units, Week 14: 463 units, Week 15: 438 units, Week 16: 383 units, Week 17: 377 units, Week 18: 429 units, Week 19: 324 units.

#### **Inventory and Backlogging Rules:**
- The inventory at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must be zero.
- The backlogged demand at the start of Week 1 and the end of Week 19 must also be zero.
- The amount ordered in any week cannot exceed the total demand over the 19-week period (7,904 units) if an order is placed in that week.

#### **Objective:**
Your task is to determine the optimal ordering schedule, inventory levels, and backlogged amounts for each week to minimize the total cost, which includes fixed ordering costs, variable ordering costs, inventory holding costs, and backlogging costs.

#### **Key Decisions:**
1. **Order Placement**: Decide whether to place an order in each week (a binary decision: yes or no).
2. **Order Quantity**: Determine the number of units to order in each week.
3. **Inventory Levels**: Decide how much inventory to hold at the end of each week.
4. **Backlogged Demand**: Determine the amount of unmet demand to backlog to the next week.

By carefully balancing these decisions, you aim to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all customer demand is met either immediately or through backlogging.",252401.0
['Assignment Problem'],"The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to minimize costs associated with unfulfilled positions and employee assignments. There are two restaurants, each with two shifts per day, and eight employees available for assignment. Each shift at each restaurant has specific staffing demands for a particular skill, and employees have varying availability and skill sets. 

Restaurant 0, Shift 0, Skill 0 requires 1 employee. Restaurant 0, Shift 0, Skill 1 requires 1 employee. Restaurant 0, Shift 1, Skill 0 requires 1 employee. Restaurant 1, Shift 0, Skill 0 requires 2 employees. Restaurant 1, Shift 1, Skill 1 requires 1 employee.

Employees can only be assigned to shifts they are available for and to roles that match their skills. Employee 0 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1. Employee 1 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1. Employee 2 is available for Shifts 0 and 1. Employee 3 is available for Shift 1 but not for Shift 0. Employee 4 is available for Shifts 0 and 1. Employee 5 is available for Shift 1 but not for Shift 0. Employees 6 and 7 are available for Shifts 0 and 1. 

Each employee is qualified for specific skills. For instance, Employees 0, 6, 7 are not qualified for Skill 0 but qualified for Skill 1, while Employees 3 and 5 are not qualified for Skill 1 but qualified for Skill 0; Employees 1, 2, 4 are qualified by both Skill 0 and 1. Each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants. Assigning employees to shifts incurs specific costs: assigning Employee 0 to Skill 1 costs 1 unit, assigning Employee 1 to Skill 0 costs 2 units and to Skill 1 costs 1 unit, assigning Employee 2 to Skill 0 costs 3 units and to Skill 1 costs 2 units, assigning Employee 3 to Skill 0 costs 2 units, assigning Employee 4 to Skill 0 costs 2 units and to Skill 1 costs 4 units, assigning Employee 5 to Skill 0 costs 3 units, assigning Employee 6 to Skill 1 costs 2 units, and  assigning Employee 7 to Skill 1 costs 1 unit. If a restaurant cannot meet the demand for a specific skill in a shift, unfulfilled positions incur a penalty cost of 100 units per position. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes the penalty costs for unfulfilled positions and the costs of assigning employees to shifts.

['Facility Dispersion Problem'],"Facility Dispersion in a Network

You are tasked with selecting a set of facilities from a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, and your goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must choose exactly 2 facilities out of the 5 available locations. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation**: For every pair of facilities, a binary decision determines whether both facilities in the pair are selected. This ensures that dispersion is only calculated for pairs where both facilities are chosen.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion across all selected facility pairs. The dispersion values between the facilities are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 24 units
- Node 0 and Node 2: 25 units
- Node 0 and Node 3: 18 units
- Node 0 and Node 4: 24 units

- Node 1 and Node 4: 24 units
- Node 2 and Node 3: 25 units
- Node 2 and Node 4: 20 units
- Node 3 and Node 4: 17 units

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected from the 5 available locations.
2. **Pairwise Activation Rules**:
   - For any pair of facilities, the pairwise dispersion can only be counted if both facilities in the pair are selected.
   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the pairwise dispersion for that pair cannot be counted.
   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the pairwise dispersion must be counted.

The backlogging cost for Item 0 is **7.516688931886524** per unit, for Item 1 is **6.810219227144024** per unit, and for Item 2 is **7.989326755092092** per unit.

The production system involves three items (Item 0, Item 1, and Item 2), two machines (Machine 0 and Machine 1), and three time periods (Period 0, Period 1, and Period 2). For each item, machine, and time period, decide whether to produce the item (binary decision) and how much to produce (continuous decision).

Decide how much inventory to carry over or how much demand to backlog for each item in each period (continuous decisions).

['Job Shop'],"In a manufacturing facility, six distinct jobs labeled Job 0 to Job 5 need to be processed on a set of machines. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation assigned to a specific machine. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, ensuring all jobs are completed as quickly as possible.

Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit. For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished, and this applies to all jobs.

If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order in which they are processed is determined by a binary decision variable. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 4 are assigned to the same machine, one must be scheduled before the other. The binary variable X_(0,1)_(4,1) determines the order: if X_(0,1)_(4,1) is 1, then Operation 1 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 4; if it is 0, then Operation 1 of Job 4 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 0. This logic applies to all pairs of operations on shared machines.

The total completion time, C_max, must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, C_max must be greater than or equal to the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0, which is S_(0,0) plus 1 unit. This applies to all operations across all jobs.

The start time of every operation must be non-negative. For example, S_(0,0) must be greater than or equal to 0, and this applies to all operations.

The binary variables X_(j,i)_(k,l) are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines and can only take values of 0 or 1.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, C_max, which represents the total time required to complete all jobs. This ensures that the manufacturing process is as efficient as possible, reducing idle time and maximizing throughput. All processing times are 1 unit, and the makespan must be at least 1 unit greater than the completion time of every operation.

['Job Shop'],"A manufacturing facility produces custom parts for seven jobs, labeled Job 0 through Job 6. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence, with the second operation starting only after the first is completed. Operations are assigned to specific machines, and some operations share the same machine, meaning they cannot be processed simultaneously. The goal is to schedule all operations to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan.

Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit. For example, Operation 0 of Job 0 takes 1 unit of time, and Operation 1 of Job 0 also takes 1 unit of time. This applies to all operations across all jobs. Operations sharing the same machine must be scheduled such that one finishes before the other starts. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 share a machine, a binary variable decides whether Operation 1 of Job 0 finishes before Operation 0 of Job 1 starts, or vice versa.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. A large constant, 100, is used in the constraints to ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring the facility operates as efficiently as possible while respecting all precedence and machine capacity constraints.

#### Objective:
Your task is to determine the optimal amount of supplies to ship between cities to meet all demands and surpluses while minimizing the total transportation cost. The shipments must respect the capacity limits of each route, and no negative shipments are allowed.

#### Constraints:
1. **Flow Balance**: For each city, the total amount of supplies shipped into the city must equal the total amount shipped out, adjusted for the city's supply or demand.
2. **Capacity Limits**: The amount of supplies shipped on any route cannot exceed the maximum capacity for that route.
3. **Non-Negativity**: All shipments must be non-negative.

By solving this problem, you will ensure that all cities receive the necessary medical supplies at the lowest possible transportation cost.",443.0
['AircraftLanding'],"You are managing the landing schedule for six aircraft at a busy airport. Each aircraft has a target landing time, but due to operational constraints, the actual landing time may vary. Your goal is to minimize the total penalty costs associated with landing aircraft either earlier or later than their target times, while ensuring safe separation between consecutive landings.

Aircraft 0 has a target landing time of 86 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 12 units per time unit for landing early and 20 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 1 has a target landing time of 60 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 90 units, and incurs a penalty of 13 units per time unit for landing early and 16 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 2 has a target landing time of 71 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 16 units per time unit for landing early and 15 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 3 has a target landing time of 97 units, can land as early as 67 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 14 units per time unit for landing early and 13 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 4 has a target landing time of 89 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 15 units per time unit for landing early and 18 units per time unit for landing late. Aircraft 5 has a target landing time of 74 units, can land as early as 60 units or as late as 100 units, and incurs a penalty of 14 units per time unit for landing early and 19 units per time unit for landing late.

To ensure safety, there must be a minimum separation time between the landings of any two aircraft. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 5 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 5 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 8 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 7 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 5 units. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 3, there must be at least 8 units of separation. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 8 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 6 units. If Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 6 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 2, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 4, there must be at least 6 units of separation. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 3, the separation must be at least 8 units. If Aircraft 3 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 5 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 3, the separation must be at least 7 units. If Aircraft 4 lands before Aircraft 5, there must be at least 6 units of separation. If Aircraft 5 lands before Aircraft 4, the separation must be at least 7 units.

Your task is to determine the actual landing times for all six aircraft such that each aircraft lands within its allowed time window, the separation requirements between consecutive landings are satisfied, and the total penalty cost, which is the sum of the penalties for landing early or late for all aircraft, is minimized. For each pair of aircraft, one must land before the other, and the separation time must be respected. The landing time for each aircraft must fall within its specified earliest and latest landing times. The penalties for landing early or late are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the target landing time.",72.0
['Job Shop'],"In a manufacturing facility, six jobs labeled Job 0 through Job 5 must be scheduled, each consisting of two operations. The goal is to minimize the total production time (makespan), ensuring all jobs are completed efficiently. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a sequence: the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For example, Operation (0,1) of Job 0 cannot start until Operation (0,0) of Job 0 is finished, and this applies to all jobs.

Certain operations share the same machine and cannot overlap in time. The machine assignments are listed explicitly below so a solver can be implemented directly. When two operations share the same machine, their order is decided by a binary variable which enforces a non-overlap constraint using a large constant N.

ADDITIONAL INPUT DATA:

1) Sets and indices
- Jobs: J = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- For each job j in J, there are 2 operations indexed k = 0..1. We denote operation (j,k) where k=0 is the first operation and k=1 is the second operation.
- Machines: M = {M0, M1, M2}

2) Machine assignment for every operation (which machine executes the operation)
- Operation (0,0) -> M0
- Operation (0,1) -> M1
- Operation (1,0) -> M0
- Operation (1,1) -> M2
- Operation (2,0) -> M1
- Operation (2,1) -> M2
- Operation (3,0) -> M0
- Operation (3,1) -> M1
- Operation (4,0) -> M1
- Operation (4,1) -> M2
- Operation (5,0) -> M0
- Operation (5,1) -> M2

3) Processing times (duration) for every operation (in time units)

"['Set Cover', 'Facility Location Problem']","Cell Tower Coverage Planning

You are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.

#### Key Details:
1. **Population Coverage**: Each area has a specific population size that can be covered if a cell tower is built in a location that serves that area.
2. **Cell Tower Options**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. The costs range from 210 units for Tower 1 to 498 units for Tower 6. Building a tower at any of these locations will enable coverage for specific areas, depending on the tower's range and location.

4. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This budget must be carefully allocated to maximize population coverage while staying within the financial limit.

5. **Decision Variables**:
   - **Build Decisions**: For each of the 29 cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no).
   - **Coverage Decisions**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered (yes or no), based on the towers built.

#### Objective:
Your primary objective is to maximize the total population covered by the cell towers. This means selecting a combination of towers to build that ensures the largest possible number of people across the 32 areas have access to cell service, while staying within the budget.

#### Constraints:
1. **Coverage Logic**: An area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers capable of serving it is built. For example, Area 1 can only be covered if at least one of Towers 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, or 28 is built.

2. **Budget Limit**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This requires careful selection of towers to balance coverage and cost.

3. **Binary Decisions**: Both the decision to build a tower and the decision to cover an area are binary (yes or no). You cannot partially build a tower or partially cover an area.

#### Numerical Parameters:

['Facility Dispersion Problem'],"Facility Dispersion in a Network of Locations

Imagine you are tasked with selecting a subset of facilities to open across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, and your goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible to optimize coverage and minimize redundancy.

#### Key Details:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must select exactly **2 facilities** to open from the five available locations. Each location can either be chosen (1) or not chosen (0) to host a facility.
2. **Dispersion Values**: The pairwise distances (dispersion values) between the locations are as follows:
   - Node 0 and Node 1: 20 units
   - Node 0 and Node 2: 20 units
   - Node 0 and Node 3: 18 units
   - Node 0 and Node 4: 18 units
   - Node 1 and Node 0: 22 units
   - Node 1 and Node 2: 21 units

   - Node 4 and Node 1: 21 units
   - Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units
   - Node 4 and Node 3: 25 units

3. **Objective**: Maximize the total dispersion between the selected facilities. This means you want to choose the two facilities such that the sum of their pairwise distances is as large as possible.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Selection Constraint**: Exactly two facilities must be selected from the five locations.
   - **Pairwise Activation**: For any two locations, the pairwise dispersion value is only counted if both locations are selected.
   - **Logical Relationships**: If a location is not selected, no pairwise dispersion involving that location can be included in the total.

#### Decision to Make:
- Which two facilities to open from the five available locations to maximize the total pairwise dispersion.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- All pairwise dispersion values are provided above.
- The total number of facilities to select is fixed at 2.

The objective is to maximize the minimum distance (MinDistance) between any two selected facilities. Exactly two facilities must be selected. For each pair of locations, if both are selected, the distance between them must be at least MinDistance. If either or both locations in a pair are not selected, the distance constraint is relaxed using a large constant (1,000,000).

"['Transportation Problem', 'Minimum Cost Flow Problem']","Managing Resource Distribution Across Cities

You are responsible for managing the distribution of a critical resource (e.g., medical supplies, food, or energy) across eight interconnected cities. Each city has a specific supply or demand for the resource, and your goal is to ensure that all cities receive the required amount while minimizing the total transportation cost. The transportation costs vary depending on the routes between cities, and each route has a maximum capacity limit for resource shipments.

['Assignment Problem'],"The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to meet specific skill demands while minimizing costs. There are seven employees, each with specific availability and skill capabilities. Each shift at each restaurant requires one employee with Skill 0. Assigning an employee to a shift incurs a cost: some assignments cost 1 unit, while others cost 3 units. If a shift cannot be filled, a penalty of 100 units is incurred per unfulfilled position.

Employees are only available for certain shifts, as specified by the availability constraints. For example, Employee 0 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1, and Employee 1 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1. Employees can only be assigned to roles that match their skills, and each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants and roles. The total number of employees assigned to a shift plus any unfulfilled positions must equal the demand for that shift.

The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of assigning employees to roles based on their preferences and the penalty cost for any unfulfilled positions. The preference costs for assignments range from 1 to 3 units, and the penalty cost for unfulfilled positions is 100 units each. The demand for each shift is one employee with the required skill.",4.0

['Job Shop'],"Minimize the total completion time (makespan) required to process all jobs in a manufacturing facility. There are 7 jobs, each consisting of 2 operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit. Operations from different jobs may share the same machine, but a machine can only handle one operation at a time. To avoid overlaps, the order of operations on shared machines must be determined. 

The start time of each operation must be non-negative, and the start time of an operation in a job must be at least 1 unit after the completion of the previous operation in the same job. For operations sharing a machine, one operation must finish before the other starts. This is enforced using binary decision variables that determine the order of operations on shared machines. A large constant (100) is used in the constraints to ensure logical consistency when determining the order of operations. 

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation across all jobs. The objective is to minimize the makespan while ensuring that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied.

Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete and is assigned to a specific machine. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, which is the maximum completion time across all operations.

For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. This ensures that the operations within a job follow a strict sequence. Additionally, each machine can process only one operation at a time. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are scheduled on the machine. If the variable is 1, the first operation is scheduled before the second; if it is 0, the order is reversed.

The constraints ensure that the start time of the second operation in a job is at least 1 unit of time after the start time of the first operation. For operations assigned to the same machine, the start time of one operation must be at least 1 unit of time after the completion of the other operation. A large number (100) is used in the constraints to enforce this order without overlapping.

The objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the order in which operations are processed on shared machines, such that the total makespan is minimized.

Each pair of locations has a specific distance value associated with it, representing how far apart they are. These distances are as follows:

- Distance between Node 0 and Node 1: 24 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 2: 22 units  
- Distance between Node 0 and Node 3: 23 units

['Job Shop'],"There are 5 jobs, each consisting of 2 operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations are assigned to machines, and each machine can process only one operation at a time. The goal is to minimize the total completion time (makespan) of all jobs by determining the start times of each operation and the order in which operations are processed on the machines.

For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation has been completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation 0 of Job 0 starts. This applies to all jobs. Operations assigned to the same machine cannot overlap in time. For every pair of operations on the same machine, one must be processed before the other. If Operation A is processed before Operation B, then Operation B must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation A completes. Conversely, if Operation B is processed before Operation A, then Operation A must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation B completes. These constraints apply to all relevant pairs of operations.

The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the makespan must be at least 1 unit of time after the start of Operation 0 of Job 0, and this applies to all operations across all jobs. All start times must be non-negative, and the order variables, which determine the sequence of operations on the machines, must be binary (0 or 1).

You are tasked with selecting a subset of facilities to open across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, with higher distances indicating better dispersion. The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible within the network.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Facility Selection**: You must decide which facilities to open. Specifically, you need to select exactly 2 out of the 5 available locations to open facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation**: For each pair of selected facilities, you must determine whether their dispersion contributes to the overall objective. This is represented by a binary decision variable that activates only if both facilities in the pair are selected.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total dispersion across all pairs of selected facilities. The dispersion values between each pair of locations are as follows:

The objective is to maximize the sum of these dispersion values for all pairs of selected facilities.

#### Constraints:
1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected out of the 5 available locations. This ensures that the solution is neither too sparse nor too dense.
2. **Pairwise Dispersion Activation Rules**:
   - For any pair of locations, their dispersion can only contribute to the objective if both facilities in the pair are selected.

Your goal is to maximize the factory's profit by optimizing production, inventory, and sales decisions while adhering to operational constraints.

The profit per unit sold is **$249** for **product_0**, **$222** for **product_1**, and **$249** for **product_2**. The holding cost for each unit in inventory is **$15** per period.

In the first period, the production of each product must equal the sum of its sales and inventory for that period. For subsequent periods, the inventory from the previous period plus the current production must equal the sum of current sales and inventory.

Each unit of **product_0** requires **2 hours** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **1 hour** on borers. Each unit of **product_1** requires **1 hour** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **1 hour** on borers. Each unit of **product_2** requires **1 hour** on grinders, **2 hours** on drills, and **2 hours** on borers.

['Job Shop'],"In a manufacturing facility, you are tasked with scheduling a set of jobs across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The goal is to determine the start times for each operation on its assigned machine while respecting the following constraints:

Each job has a predefined sequence of operations. For example, Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 must be completed before Operation 1 can begin. Similarly, Job 1 has Operation 0 and Operation 1, with Operation 0 preceding Operation 1. This pattern applies to all jobs, ensuring that no operation starts before its predecessor in the same job has finished. Specifically, for Job 0, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed, and for Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed. This logic applies to all jobs, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.

Each machine can process only one operation at a time. To prevent overlapping, the start times of operations assigned to the same machine must be carefully scheduled. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are processed. If Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled first, Operation 0 of Job 1 must start only after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished, and vice versa. Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations assigned to the same machine, ensuring no two operations overlap. A large constant (1000) is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.

The makespan is defined as the total time required to complete all jobs. It must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 6 finishes at time 100, the makespan must be at least 100. This ensures that the makespan accurately reflects the total time needed to complete all operations.

The start time of every operation must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. These variables can only take values of 0 or 1, representing the scheduling decisions. The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints. For example, the precedence constraints specify that Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed, with a required gap of at least 1 time unit. The binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if the binary variable for Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 is 1, Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.

The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. This problem requires determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to achieve the minimum total completion time.

['Job Shop'],"There are 7 jobs, labeled Job 0 through Job 6, each consisting of 2 operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation takes 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and some operations from different jobs must be performed on the same machine. To avoid conflicts, no two operations can be scheduled on the same machine at the same time. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are scheduled. The makespan, defined as the total time required to complete all jobs, must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For every pair of operations that share the same machine, a binary variable determines the order in which they are scheduled. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time. The start time of the second operation in each job must be at least 1 unit of time after the start time of the first operation. For every pair of operations assigned to the same machine, the schedule must ensure that they do not overlap. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. All start times must be non-negative. The binary variables that determine the order of operations on the same machine must be either 0 or 1. A large constant, 100, is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines. The processing time for every operation is 1 unit of time. The objective is to minimize the total time required to complete all jobs, ensuring that all operations are scheduled efficiently without violating any constraints.

['Unit Commitment Problem'],"Minimize the total operational cost, which includes the base cost of operating generators, the variable cost based on power output, and the startup cost for generators. The base cost is 80 units per generator per period for Type 0 and Type 2 generators, and 78 units for Type 1 generators. The variable cost is 4 units per MW for Type 0 and Type 1 generators, and 3 units per MW for Type 2 generators. The startup cost is 353 units for Type 0 generators, 349 units for Type 1 generators, and 351 units for Type 2 generators.

The total power output from all generators must meet or exceed the demand in each period, which is 163 MW in Period 0, 180 MW in Period 1, 208 MW in Period 2, 183 MW in Period 3, and 227 MW in Period 4. Each generator type has a minimum and maximum power output per generator: Type 0 generators must produce at least 35 MW and at most 126 MW, Type 1 generators must produce at least 35 MW and at most 130 MW, and Type 2 generators must produce at least 35 MW and at most 125 MW.

The total maximum possible output from all generators must be at least 15% higher than the demand in each period. For example, in Period 0, the total maximum output must be at least 187.45 MW. The number of generators operating in each period cannot exceed the available capacity: up to 5 Type 0 generators, 2 Type 1 generators, and 1 Type 2 generator can be operated in any period.

For example, in Period 1, the number of Type 0 generators started cannot exceed the difference between the number of Type 0 generators operating in Period 1 and Period 0. This rule applies similarly for Type 1 and Type 2 generators across all periods.

The landing times of each aircraft must fall within their specified earliest and latest possible landing times. The separation constraints must be respected, meaning that the landing times of any two aircraft must maintain the required separation based on their order of landing. The penalty for landing early is calculated as the number of minutes early multiplied by the early penalty cost, and the penalty for landing late is calculated as the number of minutes late multiplied by the late penalty cost. The objective is to determine the landing times for all five aircraft such that the total penalty cost is minimized, and all separation requirements and landing time windows are strictly adhered to.

['Unit Commitment Problem'],"Imagine you are managing a power generation system responsible for supplying electricity to a region over five distinct periods. The system consists of three types of power generators, each with unique operational characteristics and costs. Your goal is to determine the optimal number of generators to operate, the amount of power each generator should produce, and when to start up additional generators to meet the region's electricity demand at the lowest possible cost.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Number of Generators to Operate**: For each generator type (Type 0, Type 1, Type 2) and each period (Period 0 to Period 4), decide how many generators should be active.
2. **Power Output**: Determine the amount of power (in MW) each active generator should produce during each period.
3. **Generator Startups**: Decide whether to start up additional generators in each period, incurring a startup cost.

#### Objective:
Minimize the total cost of operating the power generation system, which includes:
- **Base Costs**: Each active generator incurs a fixed cost of 79 units per period, regardless of its power output.
- **Per-MW Costs**: Each generator also incurs a variable cost based on its power output: 3 units per MW for Type 0, 4 units per MW for Type 1, and 4 units per MW for Type 2.
- **Startup Costs**: Starting up a generator incurs a one-time cost of 355 units for Type 0 and 349 units for Types 1 and 2.

#### Constraints:
1. **Demand Satisfaction**: The total power output across all generators must meet or exceed the region's electricity demand in each period. The demands are:
   - Period 0: 167 MW
   - Period 1: 212 MW
   - Period 2: 224 MW
   - Period 3: 221 MW
   - Period 4: 189 MW

2. **Generator Capacity Limits**:
   - Each generator has a minimum and maximum power output:
     - Type 0: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 128 MW
     - Type 1: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 129 MW
     - Type 2: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 125 MW
   - The power output of each generator must be within these limits based on whether it is active.

3. **Reserve Margin**: To ensure reliability, the total maximum possible power output across all generators must be at least 15% higher than the demand in each period. This translates to:
   - Period 0: 192.05 MW
   - Period 1: 243.8 MW
   - Period 2: 257.6 MW
   - Period 3: 254.15 MW
   - Period 4: 217.35 MW

4. **Generator Availability**:
   - The number of generators that can be active is limited:
     - Type 0: Maximum 1 generator per period
     - Type 1: Maximum 4 generators per period
     - Type 2: Maximum 3 generators per period

5. **Startup Logic**:
   - If a generator is started in a period, it must have been inactive in the previous period.
   - For Type 2 generators, up to 2 generators can be started in Period 0 without requiring a startup cost.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- **Base Costs**: 79 units per active generator per period.
- **Per-MW Costs**: 3 units for Type 0, 4 units for Types 1 and 2.
- **Startup Costs**: 355 units for Type 0, 349 units for Types 1 and 2.
- **Demands**: 167 MW (Period 0), 212 MW (Period 1), 224 MW (Period 2), 221 MW (Period 3), 189 MW (Period 4).
- **Capacity Limits**: 
  - Type 0: 35 MW (min), 128 MW (max)
  - Type 1: 35 MW (min), 129 MW (max)
  - Type 2: 35 MW (min), 125 MW (max)
- **Reserve Margins**: 192.05 MW (Period 0), 243.8 MW (Period 1), 257.6 MW (Period 2), 254.15 MW (Period 3), 217.35 MW (Period 4).

['Lot-Sizing Problem'],"Inventory Management for a Retail Supply Chain

You are responsible for managing the inventory and ordering process for a retail supply chain over a 21-week period. The goal is to minimize the total costs associated with ordering and holding inventory while ensuring that customer demand is met each week. The costs include ordering costs, unit purchase costs, and inventory holding costs. Additionally, there are specific constraints on inventory levels and ordering decisions.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Ordering Decisions**: Each week, you must decide whether to place an order (a binary decision) and, if so, how much to order. Placing an order incurs a fixed cost, and the amount ordered cannot exceed a certain limit based on the total demand over the 21-week period.
2. **Inventory Levels**: You must manage the ending inventory each week, ensuring that it meets the flow balance constraints (i.e., the inventory carried over from the previous week plus the amount ordered equals the ending inventory plus the demand for that week).

#### Objective:
Minimize the total cost, which includes:
- **Ordering Costs**: Fixed costs for placing an order in a given week. These costs vary by week and are as follows: 459 in week 1, 555 in week 2, 547 in week 3, 530 in week 4, 436 in week 5, 401 in week 6, 490 in week 7, 462 in week 8, 479 in week 9, 563 in week 10, 456 in week 11, 442 in week 12, 530 in week 13, 427 in week 14, 512 in week 15, 574 in week 16, 430 in week 17, 424 in week 18, 484 in week 19, 507 in week 20, and 446 in week 21.
- **Unit Purchase Costs**: Variable costs for each unit ordered. These costs also vary by week and are as follows: 49 in week 1, 48 in week 2, 55 in week 3, 44 in week 4, 51 in week 5, 48 in week 6, 53 in week 7, 43 in week 8, 42 in week 9, 52 in week 10, 45 in week 11, 42 in week 12, 43 in week 13, 42 in week 14, 59 in week 15, 57 in week 16, 57 in week 17, 44 in week 18, 57 in week 19, 60 in week 20, and 43 in week 21.
- **Holding Costs**: Costs for holding inventory at the end of each week. These costs are as follows: 23 in week 1, 28 in week 2, 28 in week 3, 25 in week 4, 30 in week 5, 25 in week 6, 28 in week 7, 22 in week 8, 30 in week 9, 30 in week 10, 23 in week 11, 28 in week 12, 27 in week 13, 22 in week 14, 22 in week 15, 23 in week 16, 20 in week 17, 28 in week 18, 30 in week 19, 30 in week 20, and 24 in week 21.

#### Constraints:
1. **Flow Balance**: The ending inventory for each week must satisfy the following relationship:
   - Ending inventory from the previous week + amount ordered = ending inventory for the current week + demand for the current week.
   - The demand for each week is as follows: 150 in week 1, 132 in week 2, 135 in week 3, 178 in week 4, 133 in week 5, 173 in week 6, 161 in week 7, 195 in week 8, 110 in week 9, 118 in week 10, 131 in week 11, 198 in week 12, 118 in week 13, 120 in week 14, 129 in week 15, 148 in week 16, 189 in week 17, 178 in week 18, 145 in week 19, 161 in week 20, and 155 in week 21.

2. **Ordering Limits**: The amount ordered in any week cannot exceed the total demand over the 21-week period (3157 units) if an order is placed. If no order is placed, the amount ordered must be zero.

3. **Starting and Ending Inventory**: The starting inventory at the beginning of week 1 is zero, and the ending inventory at the end of week 21 must also be zero.

#### Goal:
Your task is to determine the optimal ordering and inventory management plan that minimizes the total cost while meeting all constraints. This includes deciding when to place orders, how much to order each week, and how much inventory to carry over each week to meet demand without exceeding the budget or violating any constraints.",165425.0

['Job Shop'],"The problem involves scheduling operations for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility, where each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and multiple operations from different jobs may need to be assigned to the same machine. A machine can only handle one operation at a time, so the order of operations on shared machines must be determined to avoid overlaps. 

The goal is to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, which is the time at which the last operation across all jobs finishes. To achieve this, the start times of all operations must be scheduled such that: (1) for each job, the second operation starts only after the first operation is completed; (2) if two operations are assigned to the same machine, one must finish before the other starts; and (3) the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. 

The order of operations on shared machines is determined using binary decision variables, which indicate whether one operation is scheduled before another. A large constant (100) is used in the constraints to enforce the sequencing of operations on shared machines. The start times of operations and the makespan are continuous variables, while the binary variables are restricted to values of 0 or 1. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring all jobs are completed as quickly as possible.

['Assignment Problem'],"""There are 2 restaurants, 7 employees, and 2 shifts per day. Each shift requires employees with specific skills, and each employee has a set of 2 skills they are qualified to perform. Employees have preferences for certain skills, and assigning them to tasks they prefer incurs lower costs. The cost of leaving a position unfulfilled is significantly higher, so the goal is to minimize both the preference costs and the number of unfulfilled positions.

Restaurant 0, Shift 0, Skill 0 requires 1 employee. Restaurant 0, Shift 1, Skill 0 requires 1 employee. Restaurant 1, Shift 0, Skill 0 requires 2 employees. Restaurant 1, Shift 1, Skill 0 requires 1 employee.

Employees have varying availability for shifts. Employee 0 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1. Employee 1 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1. Employee 2 is available for Shifts 0 and 1. Employee 3 is available for Shift 1 but not for Shift 0. Employee 4 is available for Shifts 0 and 1. Employee 5 is available for Shift 1 but not for Shift 0. Employee 6 is available for Shifts 0 and 1. Each employee is qualified for specific skills. For instance, Employee 0 is not qualified for Skill 0 but qualified for Skill 1, while Employees 3 and 5 are not qualified for Skill 1 but qualified for Skill 0; Employees 1, 2, 4 and 6 are qualified by both Skill 0 and 1. 
Assigning employees to tasks they prefer incurs lower costs. In particular, assigning Employee 1 to Skill 0 costs 2 units.
Assigning Employee 2 to Skill 0 costs 0 units. Assigning Employee 3 to Skill 0 costs 2 units.
Assigning Employee 4 to Skill 0 costs 1 unit.
Assigning Employee 5 to Skill 0 costs 3 units.
Assigning Employee 6 to Skill 0 costs 2 units. Each unfulfilled position costs 100 units, which is significantly higher than preference costs.

The goal is to assign employees to specific shifts and restaurants based on their skills and availability while determining the number of unfulfilled positions for each shift and restaurant. The total cost to minimize includes the cost of assigning employees to tasks they prefer and the penalty cost for unfulfilled positions.

The total number of employees assigned to a shift at a restaurant, plus any unfulfilled positions, must equal the demand for that shift and skill. Employees can only be assigned to shifts they are available for and tasks they are qualified for. Each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants and skills.""",7.0

['Facility Dispersion Problem'],"You are tasked with optimizing the placement of emergency response centers across a network of five critical locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall coverage and effectiveness of the response system. Each location has unique characteristics, and the goal is to select exactly three locations to establish these centers. The effectiveness of the system is measured by the combined coverage scores between the selected centers, which are determined by predefined pairwise scores representing the strategic importance of connecting each pair of locations.

#### Key Decisions:
1. **Selecting Locations**: You must choose exactly three out of the five locations to establish emergency response centers. Each location is represented by a binary decision: if a center is established at a location, it is selected (1); otherwise, it is not (0).
2. **Pairwise Coverage**: For each pair of selected locations, the coverage score is determined by the predefined pairwise importance values. These scores reflect the strategic benefit of having both locations in the network.

#### Objective:
Maximize the total coverage score across all pairs of selected locations. The coverage scores for each pair are as follows:
- Node 0 and Node 1: 24  
- Node 0 and Node 2: 21  
- Node 0 and Node 3: 16  
- Node 0 and Node 4: 15

- Node 2 and Node 1: 17  
- Node 2 and Node 3: 25  
- Node 2 and Node 4: 19  
- Node 3 and Node 0: 18  
- Node 3 and Node 1: 24

- Node 4 and Node 0: 15  
- Node 4 and Node 1: 18  
- Node 4 and Node 2: 15  
- Node 4 and Node 3: 24  

#### Constraints:
1. **Selection of Centers**: Exactly three locations must be selected to establish emergency response centers. This means the sum of selected locations must equal three.
2. **Pairwise Coverage Activation**: For any pair of locations, the coverage score is only counted if both locations in the pair are selected. This ensures that the coverage score is only applied to active pairs.
3. **Logical Relationships**:
   - If a location is not selected, no coverage scores involving that location can be counted.
   - If both locations in a pair are selected, the coverage score for that pair is fully counted.
   - If only one location in a pair is selected, the coverage score for that pair is not counted.

#### Numerical Parameters:
- The pairwise coverage scores are explicitly provided for all possible pairs of locations, as listed above.
- The total number of selected locations must be exactly three.

#### Summary:
Your task is to select three out of the five locations to establish emergency response centers such that the total coverage score, based on the predefined pairwise importance values, is maximized. The selection must adhere to the constraints ensuring that only active pairs of selected locations contribute to the coverage score.",130.0

['Flow Shop Scheduling'],"The manufacturing facility produces seven distinct products (Jobs 0 through 6) using four specialized machines (Machine 0, Machine 1, Machine 2, and Machine 3). Each product must pass through all four machines in a specific sequence, and the goal is to schedule production to minimize the total completion time (makespan), ensuring all products are completed as quickly as possible. The objective is to minimize the sum of the start time of the last product on Machine 3 and the weighted completion times of specific jobs in the final position. Each product must be assigned to exactly one position in the production sequence on each machine, and each position on each machine can only be assigned to one product. The start time of a product on a machine cannot begin until the product has completed processing on the previous machine, and the start time of a product in a later position on a machine cannot begin until the product in the previous position has completed processing on that machine. Processing times for each product on each machine are as follows: Job 0 takes 10 units on Machine 0, 5 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 7 units on Machine 3; Job 1 takes 6 units on Machine 0, 5 units on Machine 1, 10 units on Machine 2, and 9 units on Machine 3; Job 2 takes 9 units on Machine 0, 8 units on Machine 1, 6 units on Machine 2, and 9 units on Machine 3; Job 3 takes 6 units on Machine 0, 5 units on Machine 1, 9 units on Machine 2, and 6 units on Machine 3; Job 4 takes 5 units on Machine 0, 8 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 5 units on Machine 3; Job 5 takes 9 units on Machine 0, 10 units on Machine 1, 5 units on Machine 2, and 10 units on Machine 3; Job 6 takes 7 units on Machine 0, 6 units on Machine 1, 10 units on Machine 2, and 5 units on Machine 3. The objective function includes weighted coefficients for specific jobs in the final position, such as 7 for Job 0 in position 6, 9 for Job 1 in position 6, 9 for Job 2 in position 6, 6 for Job 3 in position 6, 5 for Job 4 in position 6, 10 for Job 5 in position 6, and 5 for Job 6 in position 6. The constraints ensure that each job is assigned to exactly one position on each machine, each position on each machine is assigned to exactly one job, and the start times respect the precedence relationships between machines and positions. The variables include binary assignment variables for each job and position on each machine, and continuous start time variables for each position on each machine. The bounds ensure that all start times are non-negative, and the binary variables are restricted to 0 or 1.",72.0

['Facility Location Problem'],"Cell Tower Deployment for Regional Coverage

    You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.

    #### Key Decisions:

['Facility Dispersion Problem'],"Imagine you are managing the placement of emergency response centers across five key locations in a region. Each location has the potential to host a center, but due to budget constraints, you can only establish **three centers** in total. The goal is to maximize the overall effectiveness of these centers by ensuring they are strategically placed to cover as much critical area as possible.

Each pair of locations has a predefined **effectiveness score** that represents how well a center at one location can support or complement a center at another location. These scores are as follows:

- **Location 0 and Location 1**: 18  
- **Location 0 and Location 2**: 20  
- **Location 0 and Location 3**: 22  
- **Location 0 and Location 4**: 19  
- **Location 1 and Location 2**: 15  
- **Location 1 and Location 3**: 22  
- **Location 1 and Location 4**: 16  
- **Location 2 and Location 3**: 17  
- **Location 2 and Location 4**: 22  
- **Location 3 and Location 4**: 20  

Your task is to select **three locations** out of the five to establish the centers. The effectiveness of the selected centers is determined by the sum of the pairwise effectiveness scores between the chosen locations. For example, if you select Locations 0, 1, and 2, the total effectiveness would be the sum of the scores for pairs (0,1), (0,2), and (1,2).

However, there are specific rules governing the selection:  
1. A pair of locations can only contribute to the total effectiveness if **both locations in the pair are selected** as centers.  
2. If only one location in a pair is selected, that pair does not contribute to the effectiveness score.  
3. The total number of centers must be exactly three.  

Your objective is to determine which three locations to select to **maximize the total effectiveness** of the emergency response centers, ensuring all constraints are met.",62.0
